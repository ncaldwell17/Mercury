Clinical outcome

Purpose: To report the clinical outcome of a patient with ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, treated with adreno-
corticotropic hormone gel.
Observations: A 75-year-old female with a biopsy proven ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP) presented with
bilateral conjunctival inﬂammation, fornix shortening, subepithelial ﬁbrosis and corneal scarring. The patient
was previously treated with topical steroids, topical cyclosporine and lubricating drops, and had undergone
several amniotic membrane transplants due to recurrent corneal erosions. Once OCP diagnosis was established,
the patient was started on oral corticosteroids (60 mg daily). In order to wean the patient oﬀ from systemic
steroids, other immunomodulatory agents had been tried, including mycophenolate mofetil (1000 mg twice
daily) and methotrexate (up to 25 mg weekly). However, none of these agents adequately controlled the ocular
surface inﬂammation, and the patient experienced bilateral progressive cicatrization and corneal decompensa-
tion, as well as the development of side eﬀects from the systemic corticosteroids, methotrexate and mycophe-
nolate mofetil therapies. Treatment with twice weekly subcutaneous adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) gel
was initiated, along with tapering of systemic corticosteroids. During the 19 months treatment period, the pa-
tient demonstrated signiﬁcant improvement in the ocular surface inﬂammation, visual acuity was stable and no
signiﬁcant adverse eﬀects were observed. Systemic corticosteroids dosage was successfully reduced from 10 mg/
day to none at last follow up.
Conclusions and importance: ACTH gel has shown to be an eﬀective and safe treatment option for chronic, re-
fractory and progressive ocular inﬂammatory disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst case report of
a patient with OCP, treated successfully with ACTH gel. This case report may encourage ophthalmologists to
employ ACTH gel in the management of OCP.

1. Introduction

Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP) is a speciﬁc entity in a group of
chronic inﬂammatory mucocutaneous blistering conditions, called
mucous membrane pemphigoid.1 The disease is characterized by scar-
ring and shrinkage of the conjunctiva as well as in extraocular mucous
membranes, such as the oral mucosa, esophagus, larynx, and skin.1,2
The disease commonly aﬀects females with an average age of onset of
65 years.3 OCP is diagnosed by linear antibody and complement de-
position at the epithelial basement membrane of the involved mucosa.
The earliest clinical ﬁnding is a chronic, recurrent, papillary con-
junctivitis. Recurrent attacks of conjunctival inﬂammation can lead to
destruction of goblet cells, lacrimal gland ductule obstruction, en-
tropion, trichiasis and corneal abrasions, vascularization and ulcera-
tion. Progressive cicatrization is common, as well as remissions and

exacerbations periods with therapy.

Treatment for the majority of OCP patients utilizes systemic im-
munomodulatory therapies in order to prevent cicatrization. Systemic
treatments include corticosteroids, and steroid-sparing agents, such as
cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, methotrexate
(MTX), and diaminodiphenylsulfone (dapsone).4–7 Usually, mono-
therapy with corticosteroids, along with its adverse events, is not suf-
ﬁcient to produce long-term remission, nor able to achieve an adequate
level of sustained immunosuppression in OCP patients. Furthermore,
the later the stage of disease upon initiation of therapy, the more likely
it will progress and not respond to therapy. However, the use of steroid-
sparing medications also carries potential risks and side eﬀects. Cy-
clophosphamide can cause leukopenia, anemia, bone marrow suppres-
sion, and bladder carcinoma.2 Common side eﬀects of mycophenolate
mofetil are nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever and anemia. MTX

may cause hepatotoxicity, pneumonitis, pulmonary ﬁbrosis, pancyto-
penia, and malignancy. In some patients with reluctant disease, im-
munomodulatory treatments, such as intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIg) and rituximab, have shown some success.8,9

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is a member of a group of
molecules called melanocortins (MCs), derived from the precursor
proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and endogenously produced in the hy-
pothalamic-pituitary pathway. ACTH acts primarily to stimulate and
regulate steroids production. ACTH has recently been shown to have
anti-inﬂammatory eﬀects beyond endogenous steroid production.10,11
ACTH gel was approved by the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in 1952 for a variety of autoimmune and in-
ﬂammatory conditions. ACTH gel is indicated for severe acute and
chronic allergic and inﬂammatory ocular processes including keratitis,
iridocyclitis, diﬀuse posterior uveitis and choroiditis, optic neuritis,
chorioretinitis and anterior segment inﬂammation.12 It also has shown
eﬃcacy in various systemic inﬂammatory diseases including systemic
lupus erythematosus,13 multiple sclerosis,14 nephrotic syndrome,15 in-
fantile spams,16 dermatomyositis, and polymyositis.17

To the best of our knowledge, treatment of ocular cicatricial pem-
phigoid with ACTH gel has never been reported. In this case report, we
describe the clinical course and outcome of a patient with ocular ci-
catricial pemphigoid, treated with ACTH gel.

2. Case report

A 75-year-old woman was referred in April, 2015 due to chronic
conjunctival redness, foreign body sensation, irritation and blurred vi-
sion in both eyes. She had previously been treated with topical steroids,
topical cyclosporine (0.05%) and frequent use of lubricating eye drops.
The patient had undergone amniotic membrane transplants in both eyes
due to persistent corneal epithelial defects. She has a history of open-
angle glaucoma, exudative age-related macular degeneration and cat-
aract surgery in her right eye. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)
was counting ﬁngers (CF) in both eyes at the time of initial presenta-
tion. Slit-lamp examination revealed trichiasis, conjunctival injection,
fornix shortening and subconjunctival ﬁbrosis, as well as corneal scar-
ring in both eyes. Serology testing was performed in order to exclude
other infectious and autoimmune diseases and was negative. Ocular
cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP) was conﬁrmed using conjunctival biopsy
with direct immunoﬂuorescence testing of the conjunctiva. Based on
the clinical ﬁndings, her disease was graded as stage 3.18

The patient was started on oral corticosteroids (prednisone 60 mg
daily). Following initiation of oral corticosteroids, there was interval
improvement in the ocular surface inﬂammation in both eyes. However,
the patient developed multiple side eﬀects attributed to systemic ster-
oids including nervousness, moon facies, fatigue, ecchymoses, joint
pain, swelling, and muscle weakness. In order to wean the patient oﬀ
from systemic corticosteroids, initiation of immunomodulatory therapy
was planned.

Mycophenolate mofetil was started (1000 mg twice daily), however,
the patient had discontinued treatment after two months due to severe
fatigue and persistent conjunctival inﬂammation after gradually ta-
pering systemic corticosteroids dose. Methotrexate (MTX) was then
initiated (15 mg weekly) and systemic corticosteroids were slowly ta-
pered. After three months of MTX therapy, recurrence of bilateral
conjunctival inﬂammation was observed and corneal ulcer had devel-
oped in the left eye. Methotrexate dose was increased to 30 mg weekly
and the corneal ulcer was treated with topical antibiotics until resolved.
However, the patient was still experiencing active conjunctival in-
ﬂammation, recurrent corneal epithelial defects and systemic side ef-
fects from increasing MTX dose. These side eﬀects included anemia,
poor appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, hair loss, recurrent
urinary tract
infections and was hospitalized due to pneumonia.
Adalimumab and rituximab were suggested as alternative options,
however, were not initiated because of denial for coverage for OCP by

her insurance.

The patient was started on twice weekly subcutaneous H.P. Acthar®
Gel (repository corticotropin injection; Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals,
St. Louis, MO), (80 units/ml), in June, 2016. On ocular examination,
BCVA was CF in her right eye and hand motion (HM) in her left eye.
Slit-lamp examination revealed active disease, characterized by con-
junctival injection in both eyes. Following initiation of ACTH gel, MTX
dose was gradually decreased, as well as the systemic corticosteroids.
The patient remained under adequate control with ACTH gel and MTX.
The conjunctiva remained scarred, but was no longer inﬂamed (Fig. 1).
Following 6 months of treatment with ACTH gel, the patient had cat-
aract surgery and penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) in her left eye, due to
corneal scarring and vascularization that aﬀected her vision.

On March, 2017, nine months after ACTH gel was started, the pa-
tient stopped treatment for 3 months (due to loss of coverage) and
immediately ﬂared up upon treatment cessation. Visual acuity in the
left eye has decreased from 20/100 to CF and conjunctival inﬂamma-
tion was observed in both eyes. Corneal graft rejection and ulceration
were noted in the left eye (as shown in Fig. 2), both of which subsided
after resuming ACTH gel, but had left a scar in the corneal graft. PKP
was later performed in the right eye as well, due to visually signiﬁcant
corneal scarring. On the last follow-up, after 19 months of treatment
with ACTH gel, the BCVA was CF in the right eye and 20/200 in the left
eye, no signs of inﬂammation were observed and corneal grafts were
stable in both eyes. MTX was maintained on 25 mg weekly dose, and

was well tolerated. The patient did not develop any side eﬀects to ACTH
gel treatment, and is being continued on ACTH gel and MTX regimen,
with good compliance and suﬃcient control of the disease.

3. Discussion

OCP is a devastating autoimmune blistering disease that frequently
involves the conjunctiva and causes progressive scarring. Although the
exact mechanism remains unknown, the pathogenesis includes circu-
lating autoantibodies that bind to antigens within the basement mem-
brane and activate the complement cascade, with further recruitment of
inﬂammatory cells and cytokine secretion. The release of cytokines
results in cytotoxic destruction of the conjunctival membrane, bulla
formation and ﬁbroblast activation with later progression to mucosal
scarring. In the conjunctiva, recurrent inﬂammation causes loss of
goblet cells and obstruction of lacrimal gland ductules, leading to
aqueous and mucous tear abnormalities. These tear abnormalities,
along with conjunctival scarring at the eyelid margin and mechanical
trauma from eyelid changes, further cause corneal epithelial damage.19
The clinical course and severity of OCP is variable. Without treatment,
the disease progresses in up to 75% of patients.20 Treatment of OCP is
challenging; topical and subconjunctival agents are used only as an
adjunctive measure with systemic immunomodulatory treatments,
since they are ineﬀective in controlling and halting disease progres-
sion.6,21

ACTH induces cortisol production as well as stimulating anti-in-
ﬂammatory processes by targeting melanocortin receptors present on
immune cells.10 Melanocortin receptors are expressed on a range of
immune cells throughout the body, including T cells, macrophages, B
cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and mast cells. Studies addressing the
anti-inﬂammatory eﬀects of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-
MSH), a part of the melanocortin family, focus on the suppressive eﬀect
of the peptide on expression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines.22

H.P Acthar Gel is an injectable formulation consisting of ACTH
analogue. Since there are no guidelines regarding the recommended
dosage for treatment of ocular diseases, we use a dose of 80 units/ml,
administered subcutaneously twice weekly, as indicated for other FDA
approved systemic diseases.12 Although ACTH gel is approved by the
FDA for a wide range of ophthalmologic indications, it is rarely used for
either of these indications, due to a lack of data and the high cost of
treatment. Possible adverse eﬀects are related primarily to its ster-
oidogenic action and include increased susceptibility to infection or
reactivation of latent infection, ﬂuid retention, altered electrolyte bal-
ance, increase in blood glucose, systemic hypertension, behavioral and
mood changes, weight gain, and cushingoid features, among others.12
In our case, the patient experienced multiple side eﬀects from systemic
corticosteroids, yet did not develop any of these side eﬀects while on
ACTH gel treatment.

signiﬁcant improvement of the conjunctival inﬂammation as well as of
the patients' symptoms. ACTH gel provided adequate control and the
disease remained inactive while the systemic corticosteroids dose was
successfully tapered. A ﬂare-up that occurred during treatment was
attributed to ACTH gel treatment cessation, and resolved upon re-
suming treatment.

4. Conclusions

OCP can be challenging to treat, due to persistent inﬂammatory
processes that cause progressive scarring and subsequent complica-
tions. Treatment is further complicated by the development of side ef-
fects to various therapies. According to our experience with ACTH gel
treatment in a patient with OCP for more than a year, it may play a role
in the management of patients with OCP. Better understanding the

266

physiological and pharmacological mechanisms of action of ACTH gel
and involvement of the melanocortin system, is necessary in order to
establish its role. ACTH gel may be repurposed for new indications in
the ophthalmology ﬁeld, including OCP, as it appears to be safe and can
be used as long-term treatment option for patients with chronic ocular
inﬂammatory diseases.
