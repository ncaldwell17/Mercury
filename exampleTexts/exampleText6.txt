Our study aims to observe the levels of knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) associated with sickle cell disease (SCD)
and premarital genetic counseling (PMGC) in 351 Saudi adults. The relationships between KAP levels and sociodemographic
characteristics (age, gender, marital status, and educational level) were observed. The study was conducted in King Khalid University
Hospital between February 21, 2017, and March 7, 2018. A total of 351 Saudi participants attending the primary care clinic were
selected using convenience sampling and were given a self-administered questionnaire. Overall, the 351 participants had the
best attitude (41% scoring “good”), followed by knowledge (28.8%), and, lastly, practice (19.1%). Out of the sociodemographic
characteristics, age group was the most statistically significant in all the three categories (knowledge, attitude, and practice). The >
50-year age group performed the worst in all the three categories. Despite the advancements in public healthcare measures in Saudi
Arabia, our study revealed that there are still many gaps to be filled regarding the knowledge, attitude, and practice associated with
SCD and PMGC.

1. Introduction
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited autosomal recessive
blood disorder that causes red blood cells to become rigid
and crescent-shaped [1]. This leads to several complications,
including hand-foot syndrome, recurrent infections, delayed
growth, vision problems, vasoocclusion, chronic hemolysis,
acute and chronic kidney disease, and, eventually, progressive
multiorgan damage [1–7] and stroke [8]. SCD sufferers also
have decreased life expectancy and low quality of life [3, 7–
10].

SCD is one of the most widespread monogenic diseases in
the world, with over 300,000 babies born with SCD every year
[4, 11]. It commonly affects many African and Asian coun-
tries, with the Middle East being one of the most prominently
affected regions [1, 4, 12–14]. In Saudi Arabia, studies show
that SCD is a relatively common genetic disorder. Up to 27%

of the population have the trait, with 2.6%–4.2% of which
being manifested as SCD [3, 13, 15]. The Eastern province
has the highest prevalence (145 cases/10,000 population),
followed by southwestern provinces (24 cases/10,000 popu-
lation) [3, 10, 16, 17]. High SCD prevalence in Saudi Arabia
is due to the high occurrence of consanguinity between first
cousins (> 50% of total marriages) [12–14, 18, 19] and the
population’s lack of awareness of inherited hematological
diseases [14]. Additionally, SCD carriers are resistant to
Falciparum malaria, which is endemic in the region. This
heterozygote advantage also contributes to the increased
prevalence of SCD in Arab countries [12, 13].

Recent studies show no significant changes in SCD
prevalence [1, 3, 9, 18, 20]. Previous studies have proven
that, despite the legal implementation of compulsory pre-
marital genetic counseling (PMGC), the incidence of SCD
in Saudi Arabia has not changed significantly over the last 15

2

Advances in Hematology

years [1, 9, 18, 20]. The lack of KAP regarding SCD caused an
increase in the disease incidence and a decrease in the quality
of life among the disease sufferers [1, 3, 9, 18, 20].

SCD still remains one of the biggest unspoken issues
Saudi Arabia faces today, with one of the highest prevalence
rates worldwide. Studies show that this is no coincidence, as
SCD has been directly linked to consanguinity, a common
practice in Saudi Arabia. Unlike most other diseases, cultural
stigma proved to be a direct cause of high SCD incidence
rates. This is a unique aspect of SCD KAP studies that requires
further exploration so that suitable and effective prevention
measures can be taken.

2. Materials and Methods
A cross-sectional KAP study was conducted in King Khalid
University Hospital (KKUH) between February 21, 2017, and
March 7, 2018. A total of 351 Saudi participants attending
the primary care clinic (PCC) in KKUH were selected using
convenience sampling. The sample size was calculated using
the standard single proportion formula, where the proportion
(p = 0.253) was obtained from a previous similar study [1].
After plugging in the values, the effective sample size was 𝑛
= 290. An additional 60 participants (20% of the effective
sample size) were added in case of invalid questionnaires,
with the total sample size being 351 participants.

(cid:5).(cid:2). Inclusion Criteria. Saudi males and females of all edu-
cational levels, married or unmarried, over the age of 18
attending the PCC in KKUH between February 21, 2017, and
March 7, 2018, who were able to sign the written informed
consent and able to understand either Arabic or English were
included in the study.

(cid:5).(cid:5). Exclusion Criteria. Participants who were under the age
of 18, unable to sign the written informed consent, and unable
to understand English or Arabic were excluded from the
study. To avoid selection bias, known cases and/or family
history of sickle cell disease, sickle cell trait, or any hereditary
hematological diseases were also excluded from the study.

(cid:5).(cid:6). Questionnaire. After the participants provided informed
consent, a self-administered, validated questionnaire was
given to each participant. The KAP questionnaire was
obtained from two similar previous studies with the authors’
permissions [14, 21]. Questions 1–10 asked about sociodemo-
graphic data. The rest of the questionnaire was used for KAP
assessment, where 1 point was given for every correct answer.
The knowledge section assessed the participant’s awareness
of SCD and PMGC. It contained 9 questions and, hence, the
maximum score a participant could obtain in this section was
9 points (good knowledge, 9–5 points; poor knowledge, 4–0
points). The attitude section assessed the participant’s beliefs
regarding PMGC. The maximum score a participant could
obtain in this section was 6 points (good attitude, 6–4 points;
poor attitude, 3–0 points).

The practice section assessed the participant’s imple-
mentation of PMGC in his/her life. The maximum score a

participant could obtain in this section was 3 points (good
practice, 3–2 points; poor practice, 1–0 points). Data collection
was performed with the help of trained volunteers. The
questionnaire was cross-translated from Arabic to English
and back to Arabic. The questionnaire was available in both
Arabic and English and contained a paragraph for consent
and other ethical considerations. For the illiterate group, the
questionnaire and informed consent were read and explained
to them by the trained volunteers.

(cid:5).(cid:3). Ethical Considerations. The study was approved by the
King Saud University Institutional Review Board. All par-
ticipants received a full written informed consent form in
English or Arabic. Details informing the participants about
the purpose of the research, why they were chosen, all
potential risks and benefits, and that they could refuse to
participate or withdraw from the study at any point in time
were also provided at the beginning of the questionnaire
in Arabic or English. The participants’ identities were kept
anonymous. No coercion, incentives, or rewards were used
for the participants who did not wish to participate. Private
and/or personal information was not and will not be dis-
closed during or after the study.

(cid:5).(cid:4). Statistical Methods of Analysis. The data were analyzed
using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)
Pc + 21.0 version statistical software. Descriptive statis-
tics (frequencies and percentages) were used to describe
the participants’ sociodemographic characteristics (Table 1).
Each questionnaire was graded manually to obtain 3 scores
(knowledge score, attitude score, and practice score). Based
on these scores, the frequencies of good and poor KAP
were obtained using descriptive statistics (frequencies and
percentages). Bivariate analysis between the frequencies of

each sociodemographic characteristic and the levels of KAP
(good/poor) was performed using crosstabulation (descrip-
tive statistics) (Tables 2–4). Using Pearson chi-squared test,
a p-value ≤ 0.05 and 95% confidence intervals were used to
report the statistical significance and precision of results.

3. Results
A total of 351 Saudi participants were observed for SCD
and PMGC KAP assessment. The participants were taken
from both male and female PCCs in KKUH and came from
all educational levels. Overall, the 351 participants had the
best attitude (41% scoring “good”), followed by knowledge

(28.8%), and, lastly, practice (19.1%). The most statistically
significant association with all three outcome variables was
age group, with the > 50-year age group performing the worst
in all three categories. Correlation studies between knowl-
edge, attitude, and practice showed significant correlations
between attitude and knowledge (p = (cid:7).(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:5)), practice and
knowledge (p = (cid:7).(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:5)), and practice and attitude (p = (cid:7).(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:2)).

(cid:6).(cid:2). Knowledge. Out of the 351 participants, 101 (28.8%) had
good knowledge (9–5 points out of 9) about SCD and premar-
ital screening, while the remaining 250 participants (71.2%)
had poor knowledge. The median score was 6 (interquartile
range [IQR] = 2). A total of 237 (67.5%) participants had heard

about SCD, but only 75 (21.4%) and 52 (14.8%) participants
were aware of its treatment limitations and inheritance
pattern, respectively. A total of 345 (98.3%) participants
heard of PMGC, but 153 (43.6%) did not know the specific
tests performed and diseases screened. When asked about
their main source of knowledge regarding PMGC, 132 study
participants (49.4%) chose friends and colleagues, while
only 27 (10.1%) and 18 (6.7%) participants chose healthcare
professionals and awareness programs, respectively. A total
of 330 (94%) participants were aware that PMGC limits the
spread of inherited blood disorders, and 268 (76.4%) par-
ticipants were aware that families suffer from psychological
stress if a member has an inherited blood disorder. Bivariate
analysis showed significant (p = (cid:7).(cid:7)(cid:3)(cid:6)) association between
the level of knowledge and age groups. The age group with
best knowledge was 29–39 years, with 40 out of 112 (35.7%)
participants scoring “good” for knowledge. The worst was >
50 years, with only 8 out of 48 (16.6%) participants scoring
“good” for knowledge (Table 2). The other study variables
showed no significant associations.

(cid:6).(cid:5). Attitude. Out of the 351 participants, 144 (41%) had
good attitude (6–4 points out of 6), while the remaining
207 participants (59%) had poor attitude toward PMGC.
The median score was 5 (IQR = 1). Of the 268 married
or previously married participants, 118 (44%) marriages
were consanguineous. However, 69 (83.1%) of the 83 single
participants did not prefer consanguineous marriages. A total
of 291 (82.9%) of the 351 participants claimed that positive
premarital test results would affect their decision to marry,
and 336 (95.7%) and 341 (97.2%) participants supported the
idea of compulsory premarital counseling and believed that
it is important, respectively. In total, 347 (98.8%) participants
would recommend premarital screening to others. Bivariate

analysis showed significant (p = (cid:7).(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:2)) association between
attitude and educational levels. The educational level with the
best attitude score was read/write followed by university, with
5 out of 9 (55.5%) and 104 out of 213 (48.8%) participants
scoring “good” for attitude, respectively. The worst was the
illiterate group, with only 1 out of 10 (10%) scoring “good” for
attitude. There was also a significant (p = (cid:7).(cid:7)(cid:3)(cid:6)) association
between the level of attitude and age groups. The age group
with the best attitude was 18–28 years, with 52 out of the
113 (46%) participants scoring “good” for attitude. The worst
was > 50 years, with only 11 out of 48 (22.9%) participants
scoring “good” (Table 3). The other study variables showed
no significant associations.

(cid:6).(cid:6). Practice. Out of the 351 participants, 67 (19.1%) had
good practice (3–2 points out of 3), while the remaining
284 participants (80.9%) had poor practice toward premarital
screening. The median score was 2 (IQR = 1). Out of the 268
married or previously married participants, only 147 (54.8%)
participants performed premarital screening. However, of
the remaining 83 single participants, 76 (91.5%) will do
premarital screening in the future. When asked about how
often the participants have been approached about SCD, 92
(26.2%), 137 (39%), and 122 (34.8%) chose o(cid:8)en, not o(cid:8)en,
and never, respectively. When asked about the barriers faced
in counseling for consanguinity, 113 (32.2%), 11 (3.1%), and 39
(11.1%) selected knowledge, language, and both, respectively.
The remaining 188 (53.6%) participants reported to have no
barriers. A total of 155 (44.1%) participants did not think they
needed more education about genetic counseling. Bivariate
analysis showed significant (p = (cid:7).(cid:7)(cid:2)(cid:3)) association between
the practice levels and age groups. The age group with the
best practice was 29–39 years, with 31 out of the 112 (27.6%)
participants scoring “good” for practice. The worst was >

50 years, with only 5 out of the 48 (10.4%) participants
scoring “good” (Table 4). The other study variables showed
no significant associations.

4. Discussion
Based on the results observed, it is clear that, despite PMGC
being compulsory in Saudi Arabia, many still lack good KAP
regarding PMGC and SCD. Numerous gaps regarding all the
three aspects of the study were analyzed.

(cid:3).(cid:2). Knowledge. The knowledge level of the participants in
our study (28.8% participants having good knowledge) was
inconsistent with the other studies done in Bahrain (93%)
[19], Oman (96%) [14], and Saudi Arabia (94.3%) [14, 22], but
was similar to the results in Nigeria (17.8%) [1] and Sudan
(26.9%) [2]. There was a large discrepancy in knowledge
between our study (28.8%) and El-Hazmi’s study (94.3%).
This could be because El-Hamzi’s participants were attendees
of conferences, symposia, and awareness lectures [22], while
our study participants were members of the general Saudi
population. In our study, the fact that many knew what
PMGC was but did not know what it screens for implied a
lack of awareness and concern for such inherited diseases.
When crosstabulation was performed for the screening tests
and age groups, poor knowledge was demonstrated equally in
all four age groups with no statistical significance. Moreover,
many obtained their knowledge about PMGC clinics through
friends and colleagues rather than through healthcare facili-
ties. This could indicate a need for more PMGC awareness
campaigns in healthcare institutions. Moreover, only 10.1% of
the participants obtained their knowledge of PMGC clinics
from healthcare workers. This reflects that health promotion
in personal matters such as marriage may not be appropriate
in Saudi culture. Therefore, the attitude of healthcare workers
toward PMGC promotion needs further exploration. The
cause of poor SCD knowledge among the Saudi popula-
tion is not only a deficiency in seeking knowledge but
also a deficiency in receiving knowledge from healthcare
workers.

(cid:3).(cid:5). Attitude. Our attitude results (41% participants having
good attitude) were similar to those of the previous stud-
ies in Saudi Arabia, with only 42% of the participants in
Riyadh and 29% in Abha supporting the implementation
of the compulsory PMGC law [14]. In Sudan, only 48% of
the participants had adequate attitude [2]. However, other
studies showed 86.9% and 70% of the participants supporting
compulsory PMGC, respectively [14]. In our study, the
participants performed the best in attitude out of all the
three categories, which may indicate a shift in perspective
toward consanguineous marriages. In fact, despite the high
prevalence of consanguineous marriages in Saudi Arabia
(51%–60%) [12–14, 18], most of the single participants in
our study did not prefer consanguineous marriages. This
was significantly associated with a younger age group (18–28
years) when crosstabulation was performed (p = (cid:7).(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:2)).
This could mean a decrease in consanguineous marriages
and inherited diseases in the future. When asked about the

reason for not preferring consanguineous marriages, 51 out
of the 69 single participants mentioned inherited diseases
in their answers, implying that there could be a significant
association between the increase in knowledge and the
decrease in consanguineous marriages among young, single
Saudi individuals. However, previous studies showed up to
90% of couples proceeding with marriage despite having a
positive trait for a hematological disorder, mostly due to
noncancellable wedding plans (43%–52%) and social stigma
(21%) [14, 20, 23–25]. This infers that many single individuals
do not prefer consanguineous marriages, but, when faced
with the situation, must proceed with the marriage.

(cid:3).(cid:6). Practice. Out of all the three aspects observed in our
study, the participants performed the worst in practice (19.1%
participants having good practice). Our study revealed that
the majority of the study participants did not undergo PMGC
despite it being compulsory. It is also worth mentioning that
although most married and previously married participants
did not undergo PMGC, many young, single participants
said that they will undergo PMGC in the future. This could
imply a shift in future trends regarding the prevalence of
inherited diseases [3], which needs further study. The reasons
for poor practice should also be explored. In our study, lack of
knowledge was the main reason for poor practice. This could
be due to the barrier between healthcare workers and patients
regarding sensitive topics such as marriage. Poor knowledge
being the main cause of poor practice was consistent with
other studies, along with misinterpretations of Islamic law
[14, 23, 26], which was not explored in our study. Language
was another main barrier among the study participants,
similar to that seen among Dominicans in a study done in
Manhattan [27]. Poor practice among the study participants
may also indicate the lack of law regulation and governmental
monitoring regarding PMGC.

(cid:3).(cid:3). Strengths. Our study adds more to the scarce literature
[14]. The study participants were taken from the PCC in
KKUH, which was representative of the Saudi population.
Our study explored all three aspects of a KAP study, while
most studies about PMGC solely focused on practice [14,
19, 23]. Age groups had high variability, which was a good
representation of the Saudi population. The study had an
adequate sample size with a high response rate. Open-ended
questions were asked to find the root cause of the problem.

(cid:3).(cid:4). Limitations. Our study did not use random sampling,
which created selection bias. The questionnaire did not
contain an equal number of questions for KAP assess-
ment, and practice questions were deficient. The study used
“good” and “poor” for KAP assessment instead of “good,”
“adequate,” and “poor.” There were fewer males (28.5%)
than females (71.5%) who participated in the study and
more married/previously married (76.4%) participants than
previously unmarried (23.6%) participants, which was not
representative of the population. Known cases and/or family
history of SCD, sickle cell trait, or any other hereditary
hematological diseases were excluded from our study. This
limited the potential to compare results between participants

with personal/family history of hereditary hematological
diseases and participants without.

5. Conclusion
Despite the advancements in public healthcare measures in
Saudi Arabia, our study revealed that there are still many gaps
to be filled regarding the knowledge, attitude, and practice
associated with SCD and PMGC. The challenges that Saudi
Arabia faces for SCD control and prevention are numerous
[3], and the implementation of PMGC law has not shown
benefit in some studies [1, 3, 9, 18, 20]. Exploring these
complex challenges in detail will help create an efficient and
cost-effective plan for SCD prevention.

Additional Points
Future studies should focus on the expected decrease in
inherited hematological diseases and its association with the
decrease in consanguineous marriages. A KAP study focusing
on single, young individuals in Saudi Arabia regarding SCD
and PMGC should also be conducted to detect future trends.
A KAP study comparing Riyadh to more rural areas in Saudi
Arabia should be conducted, as rural areas tend to have
different results than urban areas. Barriers of poor PMGC
practice should be explored, especially regarding healthcare
workers’ attitudes toward PMGC promotion. Inconsistencies
regarding consanguineous marriages must also be explored,
as many single participants said that they did not prefer
consanguineous marriages, despite its steady high prevalence.
A study measuring the KAP level difference between partic-
ipants with family history of SCD and participants without
should also be conducted.

Conflicts of Interest
The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.
