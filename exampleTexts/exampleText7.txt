Background. Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is the most prevalent monogenic disease in Brazil. In SCA, haemoglobin S (HbS) is formed,
which modifies red blood cell morphology. Intravascular haemolysis occurs, in which free Hb and free radicals degrade nitric oxide
(NO) and release arginase, which reduces arginine levels. Because arginine is a substrate for NO formation, this decrease leads to
reduced NO (vasodilator) synthesis. SCA treatment uses hydroxyurea (HU) to maintain high foetal haemoglobin (HbF) levels and
reduces HbS to avoid haemolytic episodes. Objective. To analyse the efficacy of L-arginine as an adjuvant in the treatment of SCA
patients. Setting. The State Blood Centre of Cear´a, Brazil. Methods. This was a randomized double-blind clinical study of adults
with SCA with continuous use of HU at the State Blood Centre of Cear´a. The clinical study enrolled 25 patients receiving HU +
L-arginine (500 mg) and 25 patients receiving HU + placebo. The treatment was carried out over four months. Laboratory tests were
performed to determine the levels of the following: (1) complete blood count; (2) nitrite + nitrate; (3) HbF; and (4) reticulocytes.
The clinical experiments were performed by a haematologist. The main outcome measures were nitrite and pain. Results. Statistical
analysis showed that the levels of NO were increased in the study group, and there was also a reduction in pain frequency using
a pain frequency scale by day, week, and month. The levels of nitrite plus nitrate in the group receiving placebo plus HU did not
change among the times evaluated (38.27 ± 17.27 mg/L, 39.49 ± 12.84 mg/L, 34.45 ± 11.25 mg/L, p >0.05), but in the patients who
received supplementation with L-arginine plus HU, a significant increase in nitrite plus nitrate levels was observed between M0
and M4 (36.55 ± 20.23 mg/L versus 48.64 ± 20.63 mg/L, p =0.001) and M2 and M4 (35.71 ± 15.11 mg/L versus 48.64 ± 20.63 mg/L,
p <0.001). It is important to note that the increase in nitrite plus nitrate levels occurred only in the fourth month of follow-up of
patients in the treatment group, showing that at least 4 months of supplementation with L-arginine is necessary to show an increase
in these metabolites in the serum. Conclusion. The use of L-arginine as a coadjuvant in the treatment of sickle cell anaemia may
function as a potential tool for pain relief, consequently improving the life of patients.

1. Introduction

Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is a genetic disease caused by a
point mutation in the beta globin gene in which a glutamic
acid is replaced by a valine, resulting in the synthesis of
a new haemoglobin, haemoglobin S (HbS), which forms
polymers in the red blood cells at low oxygen tension. It also
makes membranes more rigid, thus modifying membrane

morphology and function [1]. In this way, the transport of
oxygen is compromised, and a deposition of these red cells in
the endothelial wall occurs, which can lead to chronic inflam-
mation, difficult microcirculation, pain, hospitalization, and
stroke [2, 3].

Arginine is an essential compound for the formation
of nitric oxide (NO), which is a potent vasodilator. It is
found in reduced levels in SCA patients, which may cause

2

impairment in the microcirculation, recurrent pain, and
hospitalization. Studies have shown that, with increased L-
arginine availability, there is greater NO synthesis, which
leads to improved microcirculation and patient clinical pro-
files [2–5].

This is because L-arginine is a substrate for NO produc-
tion. During haemolysis, arginase, an enzyme that metab-
olizes L-arginine and contributes to a decrease in NO
concentration in SCA patients, is released. Other studies
have demonstrated that NO is a cofactor for the enzyme
guanylate cyclase, which is responsible for the conversion of
guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanine monophos-
phate (cGMP). cGMP is responsible for smooth and vascular
muscle relaxation and vasodilation [6–8].

Currently, to reduce haemolytic episodes, pain, and vessel
occlusion, SCA treatment uses hydroxyurea (HU), which is
used to maintain high foetal haemoglobin (HbF) levels and
consequently reduce haemoglobin S (HbS) concentrations.
Other positive effects associated with the use of hydroxyurea
may be attributed to nitric oxide. There are several mecha-
nisms involved in the production of nitric oxide from HU,
such as the catalase-mediated pathway, urease-dependent
formation, and NO production catalysed by horseradish per-
oxidase. More recently, the role of HU in inducing eNOS (NO
endothelial synthetase) for NO production in endothelial
cells has also been demonstrated [9–12]. In fact, this drug
has been shown to be useful in relieving pain in patients
with sickle cell anaemia, and the vasodilatation resulting from
the formation of hydroxyurea-derived NO may be one more
mechanism by which HU can benefit these patients [13].
Therefore, investigating whether L-arginine supplementation
can enhance the effects of HU becomes mandatory since this
amino acid plays an important role as a substrate for NO
production.

In this context, the aim of this study was to analyse
whether there is an increase in nitric oxide levels, measured
by nitrite plus nitrate levels, in patients who use HU plus L-
arginine as supplemental treatment compared to the nitric
oxide levels in patients using HU plus placebo.

2. Materials and Methods
The clinical trial was a randomized, double-blind, and
placebo-controlled study. The patients were randomized by
the GraphPad prism program. Fifty adult patients of both
sexes with a clinical and molecular diagnosis of SCA in
their follow-up periods at the Blood Centre of the State of
Cear´a (HEMOCE) participated in the study. The inclusion
criteria included adult patients using HU and baseline data
according to the criteria of Ballas (2012): absence of painful
episodes and/or intercurrent illnesses, such as infections and
inflammations in the four weeks prior to the study; absence
of hospital admissions in the last 2-3 days prior to study;
and the absence of blood transfusion in the four months
preceding the study [14]. The exclusion criteria were absence
of a molecular diagnosis of SCA, pregnancy, presence of renal
disease, not using HU, and a history of transfusion in the last
six months.

Patients who participated in the study are seen at the
haemoglobinopathies clinic regularly to continue their treat-
ment with hydroxyurea. We use the moment when they
returned to carry out the instruction and the trial.

The groups were separated in a randomized, double-
blind trial in which only the main author had the infor-
mation regarding the groups and the respective patients.
Therefore, there are no other names in contributorship
statement/acknowledgements. The physician who cared for
the patients is a coauthor of this article.

Patients were stratified into two groups: (1) the first group
consisted of 25 subjects who used HU + L-arginine at a dose
of 500 mg/day and (2) the second group consisted of 25
subjects taking HU + placebo (starch). The HU doses ranged
from 500 to 1500 mg/day and were not modified during the
trial. Biological samples were obtained at specific timepoints:
(1) before receiving supplementation with placebo or L-
arginine (M0); (2) two months after placebo or supplementa-
tion with L-arginine (M2); and (3) four months after placebo
or supplementation with L-arginine (M4). The arginine dose
was defined based on an earlier study performed by the same
group [5]. The trial time was determined by the clinical staff
of the Blood Centre of the State of Cear´a. It was not possible to
use a group that used only arginine because of the treatment
protocol of the institution.

The outcome measures were the nitric oxide dose mea-
sured by nitrite plus nitrate levels using a nitrite/nitrate,
colorimetric assay kit, Roche5; foetal haemoglobin levels
measured by HPLC; and reticulocyte and complete blood
count. To measure pain frequency, a time scale was used
to stratify the patients. The scale divided the patients into
5 pain categories: never (absence of pain), every day, every
week, every month, and every year. As was done for pain
assessment, a scale was created to measure the frequency of
hospitalizations. The patients were stratified into the follow-
ing: never hospitalized, hospitalized 5 years ago, hospitalized
3 years ago, and hospitalized this year. The other clinical and
historical data of the patients were obtained from medical
records.

Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 21
Statistics. For the analysis of the normality of the data, the
Shapiro-Wilk test was used. For the analysis of the quanti-
tative variables, a Mann-Whitney test or two-way repeated
measures ANOVA were used. For the analysis of categorical
variables, the Pearson’s chi-square test or Fisher’s test was
used. Values of p <0.05 were considered significant.

The study was approved by the Ethics and Research
Committee of the Federal University of Cear´a with number
1.292.517, and it was registered in the Brazilian Registry of
Clinical Trials with the number U1111-1201-6937. The patients
were required to sign an informed consent form.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Patients. The mean age of patients enrolled in the study
was 28 years, and a similar mean was observed in both of the
groups, the placebo group and the treatment group. Most of
the patients were female (52%), and the female-male ratio was
approximately 1.1:1. Gender and age were matched between

Advances in Hematology

patients in the placebo and study groups. In addition, there
was no difference in clinical manifestations or time of
treatment with HU between the groups studied, showing that
the baseline characteristics were similar between the groups
(Table 1). The duration of HU use before the trial ranged from
2 to 180 months with a median of 48 months. No adverse
effects were observed during the 4 months of the trial. There
was no significant difference in the nitrite/nitrate levels in the
serum based on the HU doses (p = 0.643).

3.2. Haematological Parameters. In patients
for whom
haematological data were available, no significant difference
was observed between patients in the placebo group and
in the study group, showing that supplementation with L-
arginine had no influence on the haematological parameters
evaluated when compared to patients receiving placebo
(Table 2).

3.3. Measurement of Nitrite Plus Nitrate and Analysis of the
Frequency Pain. The levels of nitrite plus nitrate in the group
receiving placebo plus HU did not change among the times
the levels were evaluated (38.27± 17.27 mg/L, 39.49 ± 12.84
mg/L, 34.45 ± 11.25 mg/L, p >0.05), showing that placebo
had no influence on nitrite plus nitrate levels. Patients who
received supplementation with L-arginine plus HU showed a
significant increase in nitrite plus nitrate levels between M0
and M4 (36.55 ± 20.23 mg/L versus 48.64 ± 20.63 mg/L, p
=0.001) and M2 and M4 (35.71 ± 15.11 mg/L versus 48.64 ±
20.63 mg/L, p <0.001) (Figure 1). It is important to note that
the increase in the nitrite plus nitrate levels occurred only in
the fourth month of follow-up of the patients in the treatment
group, indicating that at least 4 months of supplementation
with L-arginine is necessary to show an increase in these
metabolites in the serum.

The chi-square test showed a reduction in pain frequency
in the study group compared to that of the placebo group (p
=0.027). Table 3 shows a reduction in the frequency of pain
in patients in M4, showing that patients who presented pain
every day started to have pain every week or every month.
Interestingly, the change in pain frequency coincided with
the increase in nitrite plus nitrate levels, suggesting a possible
relationship between these two variables.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first placebo-
controlled double-blinded, randomized clinical trial that has
tested the therapeutic potential of oral L-arginine supple-
mentation over a four-month period in adult patients with
SCA who are undergoing a classic treatment with basal HU.
Our results suggest that this association may be beneficial
for patients with sickle cell anaemia since a reduction in the
frequency of pain was observed in patients who used HU plus
L-arginine supplementation. This reduction was dependent
on treatment time as observed from serum levels of nitrite
plus nitrate, indicating a strong relationship between pain
frequency and serum levels of these metabolites.

Nitrite and nitrate are stable products of NO metabolism
that are accessible for quantification. They are present in both
blood samples and urine samples. The measurement of nitrite
and nitrate is considered the most adequate and practical

way to evaluate the synthesis of NO in vivo. The colorimetric
method used in our study is based on the Griess reaction,
which involves the indirect determination of NO through the
spectrophotometric measurement of its stable decomposition
products, NO2- and NO3- [15].

It was not possible to include a group not being treated
with HU because the hospital in which the treatment was
performed treats patients with SCA with HU. However, in
an earlier study in the same city, but in another hospital, it
was possible to determine that the mean nitrite/nitrate level
of patients was 25.63 mg/L, which was well below the indices
in our study [16].

Previous studies conducted by our research group have
shown an increase in nitrite levels in patients using HU in
combination with L-arginine; however, we did not evaluate
the influence of L-arginine on the frequency of pain in these
patients [5]. Lopez et al. (1996) showed that levels of nitric
oxide metabolites were inversely correlated with pain scores
in patients with SCA with vaso-occlusive crises, suggesting
the role of NO in pain [17]. Another study using inhaled NO
also showed a decrease in pain score in patients with SCA
who inhaled NO, reinforcing their role in pain relief [18].
In 2013, in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial using oral
or intravenous L-arginine hydrochloride as a source of NO,
Morris et al. (2013) demonstrated a 54% reduction in opioid
use in children with SCA. In this same trial, the reduction

in pain scores in children was observed in the study group
versus the placebo group [19]. Cox et al. (2018) showed that
arginine and citrulline treatment in children did show a
benefit in measures of endothelial function compared with
the same measures at baseline [20].

Our results are consistent with previously published
data indicating that the use of L-arginine may reduce the
frequency of pain in patients with sickle cell anaemia,
demonstrating that it is a potential tool for improving the
quality of life of these patients. This may be partly due to the
increased serum levels of nitrite plus nitrate, which reflects
increased NO, a known lacking vasodilator in patients with
SCA that is associated with pain [16, 21].

Despite the few studies using L-arginine as a source
of NO in SCA, many studies have shown the benefits of
NO. For example, it has been reported that NO can be
produced by the vascular endothelium from L-arginine and
is able to regulate normal vascular tone and inhibit platelet
activation, haemostatic activation, and the expression of
adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1, which is a marker of
endothelial activation that is implicated in binding to 𝛼4𝛽1
adhesion molecules present in sickle red blood cells [22, 23].
The adhesion of sickle red blood cells to the endothelium, in
turn, has been implicated in the initiation and propagation
of vaso-occlusive events, as demonstrated in previous studies
using an in vitro adhesion assay or an ex vivo perfusion
model in rats [24]. Additionally, NO has been shown to
reduce the adhesive properties of neutrophils to the vascular
endothelium in SCA, an important event for the development
of vaso-occlusive crises [25, 26].

In addition, Villagra et al. (2007) also reported that
sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor known to poten-
tialize NO-mediated signalling, was able to reduce platelet
activation, which supports a role for NO-based therapeutics
since platelet activation may play an important role in the
adhesion of sickle red blood cells to the vascular endothelium
[27]. Interestingly, platelet activation has been found to be
elevated in patients with steady-state SCA, and this elevation
is even greater during vaso-occlusive crises [26]. Taken
together, these reports suggest that source-independent NO
can benefit patients with sickle cell disease by acting on
several cellular components involved in the genesis of vaso-
occlusive crises. Here, we used L-arginine as a source of NO;
L-arginine is a safe and effective amino acid that is reported
to have narcotic-sparing effects that may be a beneficial
complement to the treatment of patients with SCA [19].

Relatively recent studies have shown that the decompo-
sition products of NO, nitrite and nitrate, can be recycled
in vivo for the production of NO, representing an alterna-
tive source of this gas. This process occurs mainly under
conditions of hypoxia in which the activity of the oxygen-
dependent NOS enzyme is compromised [28]. In this context,
we hypothesized that supplementation with L-arginine may,
in addition to serving as a substrate for NO production by
the NOS-dependent pathway, increase the supply of nitrite
and nitrate to function as a storage pool that is available for
NO production in conditions of low oxygen tension, such
as the conditions that occur during vaso-occlusive crises.
The increased NO levels may not only prevent vaso-occlusive

crises but also attenuate or even resolve them. It is important
to note that, during our study, no patient receiving HU plus L-
arginine supplementation experienced complications of the
disease.

4. Conclusions
In summary, our data indicate a strong relationship between
increased levels of NO metabolites and decreased pain
frequency in patients with SCA, which supports the use of
L-arginine supplementation as an adjuvant in the treatment
of these patients. These data are the first to demonstrate
this relationship in adult patients with SCA; however, more
studies are needed with a larger number of individuals and
longer follow-up to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-
term supplementation with L-arginine.
