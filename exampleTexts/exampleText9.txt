Objectives: To examine outcome of bilateral extracranial to intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgeries for a Down syn-
drome patient with hard-to-treat epilepsy and moyamoya.
Materials and methods: Superﬁcial temporal arteries were anastamosed using an indirect bypass technique to
middle cerebral arteries bilaterally to help limit perfusion deﬁcits and seizure controls.
Results: Two superﬁcial temporal to middle cerebral artery indirect bypass surgeries were performed within 3
months. Post-revascularization improvements included seizure control, gait, perfusion, wakefulness, language
and quality of life.
Conclusion: In patients with Down syndrome and moyamoya, improvements in seizure control and quality of life
may occur with EC-IC bypass procedures.

1. Introduction

2. Materials and methods

Down syndrome is associated with epilepsy and seizure burdens
may worsen with age and progression of associated dementia [1,2].
Down syndrome may predispose to progressive intracranial vascular
narrowing associated with moyamoya syndrome [3–9]. Moyamoya is
a vascular syndrome of proximal internal carotid artery terminus
narrowings and resultant poor perfusion and elevated stroke risk
typically involving the anterior cerebral and middle cerebral artery
territories [3–9]. Of patients with Down syndrome and moyamoya,
approximately 26% may have epilepsy [10].

Perfusion abnormalities due to moyamoya may beneﬁt from surgical
revascularization with extracranial to intracranial artery bypass (EC-IC
bypass), though outcomes mainly assess stroke-related compromises
[10,11]. In this report we discuss the worsening of seizure controls
due to moyamoya induced vascular narrowing and the betterment of
both CNS perfusion and seizure control with bilateral surgical revascu-
larization using EC-IC bypass.

With informed parental consent, medical records were accessed and
abstracted for data on seizure frequency, imaging, surgical interventions
and both clinical and imaging outcomes. MRI Perfusion techniques were
preformed according to RAPID software (Menlo Park, CA, USA) [12].

3. Case report

A 27-year-old female with Down syndrome, drug resistant epilepsy
with recurrent focal impaired awareness seizures presented with wors-
ening seizures. Imaging with both cerebral angiography and MRI dem-
onstrated bilateral moyamoya disease (Figs. 1, 2), with classic ﬂow
compromise beginning at the terminus of bilateral internal carotid ar-
teries. Over an 18 month period, serial MR perfusion studies utilizing
Tmax (the time to maximum of the residue function) as a surrogate
marker of cerebral hypoperfusion were obtained and showed increasing
perfusion delays over the bilateral middle and anterior cerebral artery
territories, concomitant with worsening seizure control (Fig. 2). Events
could cluster and were exacerbated by presumptive orthostatic posi-
tional changes such as standing after prolonged sitting or toileting. On
EEG a diffuse, poorly lateralized high voltage bifrontal pleomorphic
delta was evident at baseline, though no falling events were captured
on EEG. A multitude of anti-seizure medications were trialed and
while they may have shown initial betterment of seizure controls,

over the course of several years seizure control declined. Seizure types,
medication burdens and time-based progression of ﬁndings, including
seizure control are documented in the table. Her pre-operative exam
was notable for classic phenotype of an ambulatory patient with
Down syndrome in addition to minimal responsivity, progression to-
wards expressive more than receptive aphasia and profound fatigue.

Because of increasing number of seizures and falls, and the known
worsening in cerebral perfusion, she underwent a left indirect external

carotid to internal carotid circulation bypass. Speciﬁcally the posterior
auricular branch of the external carotid artery was sewn to the pial sur-
face of the brain with dural eversion and temporal muscle placement on
brain surface in an encephaloduromyosynangiosis (EDAMS) procedure.
The more traditional donor of the superﬁcial temporal artery was not
utilized as it was already providing some collateral circulation to the
brain. This was true of bilateral superﬁcial temporal arteries. She recov-
ered well and 3 months later returned for the same procedure on the

right side. Intraoperatively the posterior auricular branch was found to
be extremely small, even for an onlay graft in continuity; and so only
dural inversions and temporal muscle onlay grafts were performed.

Surgical outcomes post-operatively were excellent, At 15 months
post-left bypass at one year post-right bypass there's been marked im-
provements while on triple drug anti-seizure medications (Table 1).
She was more alert, showed a resolution of aphasia, used more spontane-
ous speech than she had in decades, no longer fell or slumped, and
remained awake and alert during the day. Nine-month post-operative
MRI scan shows marked improvements in bilateral CNS perfusion (Fig. 2).

4. Discussion

In Down syndrome patients with moyamoya we came across prior
bypass attempts mainly using encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis [6].
The exact surgery involved is not described, though the outcome was
a cessation of “further episodes.” Cramer reported ﬁve patients with
Down syndrome and moyamoya who were treated with bilateral pial
synangiosis with no further strokes though no comment is made on sei-
zure outcomes [9]. Cramer's series is probably included in a later case
series of surgical outcomes with pial synangiosis which was performed
in 49 of 51 surgeries from 32 children with Down syndrome and
moyamoya, two in that series had direct EC-IC bypass [10]. From that
same series clinical outcomes as measured by modiﬁed Rankin scores
improved, one of 32 children had seizure control worsen postopera-
tively, epilepsy improvement outcomes pre- vs. post-surgery were oth-
erwise not studied. Surgical complications were slightly higher in
children with Down syndrome (5.9%) than in moyamoya patients with-
out Down syndrome (4%) though long-term revascularization was bet-
ter in patients with Down syndrome.

It has been postulated that chromosome 21 encodes a protein that
may predispose to pathogenesis of moyamoya [9]. Furthermore, there
may be amyloid precursor protein effects (housed on chromosome
21) that similarly predispose to progressive myoclonus epilepsy [2].
Given improvements in cognitive function postoperatively, we

speculate the main reason for our patient's worsening of seizure control
relates more to the progressive declines in cortical perfusion than amy-
loid deposition or dementia related changes.

5. Conclusion

Moyamoya should be assessed as an etiology for seizure controls
worsening in patients with Downs syndrome. Importantly, EC-IC bypass
procedures performed in a Down syndrome patient with moyamoya
and hard-to-treat epilepsy had an outstanding outcome on seizure con-
trol, brain perfusion, cognition and quality of life. Based on this result,
we suggest further study of epilepsy outcomes after revascularization
procedures in patients with moyamoya, Down syndrome and epilepsy.
