Abstract

Background: Patients with extensive burns usually develop pro-coagulation soon after the injury if there is no
sepsis occurred. We describe the case of an extensive burn adult suffering from hypocoagulation not related to
sepsis, but secondary to antibiotic treatment.
Case presentation: Here, we report a case of an adult male patient suffering from flame burns of 45% total body
surface area (40% full thickness) combined with inhalation injury. Hypocoagulopathy with soaring prolonged activated
partial thromboplastin time value occurred on third week post-burn while systemic infection had been under control
by application of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Investigations showed that not the infection but vitamin K-related
coagulation factor deficiency were responsible for unexpected bleeding. However, supplemental vitamin K was
not the key as we expected, which prompted us trying to decode the underlying cause of coagulation
disturbance in this patient and pick out the most effective treatment for live-saving. After the withdrawal of
highly suspected broad-spectrum antibiotic, Meropenem®, disturbed vitamin K related coagulation factors
gradually restored to their optimal levels so as to maintain normal coagulation status. Therefore, surgical
procedures without further risk of bleeding could be carried out in time for wound recovery. The patient was
discharged on post-burn day 67 and transferred to a secondary hospital for his rehabilitation.
Conclusion: Hypocoagulopathy may be devoted to different reasons other than sepsis in extensive burns. Early
recognition of the cause for coagulation disturbance is critical to make appropriate treatment and save patients’
lives. This case illustrated the importance of unveiling the mist cause for coagulation disturbance occurred in
extensive burn patient, which paved the way for optimal life-saving treatments. And we also recommend burn
surgeons to be alerted to antibiotic-induced vitamin K deficiency-related coagulopathy among critical burn patients.

Background
Patients with extensive burns usually develop pro-coagu-
lation soon after the injury if there is no sepsis occurred.
Hypocoagulation seldom comes upon critically burned
patients, except in those with severe infection or sepsis
with dissemination intravascular coagulation (DIC). We

Case presentation
A 40-year-old male, weighing 65 kg, suffered from flame
burns of 45% total body surface area (TBSA) (40% full
thickness) combined with inhalation injury, affecting his
face, neck, trunk, upper extremities, and right lower ex-
tremity. He was rescued by the firemen from the acci-
dental site and directly sent to the local hospital, which
provided sufficient fluid resuscitation during hypovol-
emic stage post-burn. Negative personal medical history
and family history were confirmed while the patient was
transferred to our hospital for further treatment on the

post-burn day (PBD) 3. Topical usage of 1% silver sulfa-
diazine (1%SD-Ag cream) was served as wound manage-
ment together with surgical procedures of escharectomy
(upper extremities and right lower extremity) and het-
erograft on PBD 4, consecutively 2 autografting on PBD
10 and 16. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, Meropenem®
(1.0 g three times daily), was applied intravenously since
PBD 3 as the empirical therapy for extensive burn pa-
tients and continued for ensured Pseudomonas aerugino-
sa-positive of the wound in this patient (Fig. 1). Calorie
intake of Fresubin® 1000 mL/day was commenced on
PBD 5 via gastrointestinal (GI) tube as a supplemental
nutrition other than oral intake of normal food, except
on those days of surgical procedures. Not until PBD 13
did the patient show the signs of infection, such as chill,
high fever, wounds infiltration, delirium, and neutrocyto-
sis (Figs. 2 and 3), while his hemodynamic status
remained stable, all coagulation criteria within normal
range. Wound and blood culture were both reported
Klebsiella
(multi-drug-resistant
strain, tigecycline medium). Hence, treatment with tige-
cycline (0.5 g three times daily) was initiated intraven-
ously on PBD 13,
together with Meropenem®, and
worked well in controlling those infections till PBD 18.
All lab findings coordinate with the severity of the pa-
tient during that period of time, including his coagula-
tion status.

Nevertheless, concurrent with remission of signs of se-
vere infection, there came the abnormal oozing of blood
on the donor site during the third autografting and un-
controlled bleeding while removing the central venous
line on PBD 23, which related to the prolonged activated
partial thromboplastin time (APTT) 61.5 s, normal range
25.1–39.5 s, while prothrombin time (PT) 15.6 s, normal
range 10.0–16.0 s, and the international normalized ratio
(INR) 1.32 were normal. An intravenous bolus of 10 mg
vitamin K1 was applied during the procedure and contin-
ued in the following 5 days. Further investigation of the
patient’s coagulation status was launched after the oper-
ation. There was no sign of DIC at this time, with normal
value of platelets (227 × 1012/L), fibrin degradation prod-
ucts (FDP) 4.7 mg/L, normal range 0-5 mg/L, D-dimer
1.68 mg/L, normal range < 0.55 mg/L, and slightly reduced

(VKD) was
reason for
coagulopathy in this patient. Unfortunately, specific detec-
tion of serum vitamin K concentration and protein in-
duced in vitamin K deficiency (PIVKD) were not available
in our hospital. However, what really mattered was to re-
lief
further risk of bleeding and coagulation crash as
quickly as possible. Thereafter, supportive therapies, such
as 200 ml fresh frozen plasma (FFP), was administered
daily for consecutive days and 600 IU prothrombin com-
plex was infused on PBD 26 when the patient was diag-
nosed of hypothrombinemia. Although the coagulation
status remained abnormal on PBD 27, surgical debride-
ment of the neck, trunk, and right lower extremity and
grafting were performed. There was no abnormal bleeding
either on the donor site or burn wounds, and wound heal-
ing of any sites was not interfered. At the same time, ap-
plication of vitamin K1 intravenously increased to 20 mg
daily for another 15 days, but showed mild effect to re-
verse the surging APTT level.

Nothing should be considered as the first priority, ex-
cept finding out the exact reason for VKD. Concerning
no short of vitamin K intake, no impairment of liver
function, and vitamin K recycling occurred in this case,
but scarcity of endogenous vitamin K generated by intes-
tinal bacterial flora soon came to our view. Meropenem®
application was discontinued on PDB 34. Interestingly,
2 days after, APTT improved to 47 s and came back to
the normal range on PDB 39 along with normal value
of coagulation factor II, VII, IX, and X (Figs. 1 and

with multi-resistant strain of Klebsiella pneumonia

performed for grafting on PBD 40 and 52. Tigecycline
and fosfomycin sodium were applied in the same dos-
age as previously used for multi-drug-resistant Klebsi-
ella pneumonia still detected in wound culture. The

Discussion
Patients with severe burns usually develop pro-coagula-
tion soon after the injury. Elevated fibrinogen levels are
often present immediately following burn injury, owing
to the shift in hepatic protein synthesis to acute-phase
proteins including complements, interleukins, fibrino-
gens, and etc. [1], while dilution effects might explain
the temporal reduction in the levels of coagulating pro-
teins during the early resuscitation phase with no co-
agulation function affected. For those combined with

injury,

hypercoagulability occurred among patients after PBD
4 [2, 3]. Furthermore, extensive endothelial impairment
ignites coagulation cascade, which intimately inter-
twined with inflammation reaction following the ther-
mal injury and during infection [4]. And along with the
wound recovery, coagulopathy is less related to burn
injury but more likely owe to sepsis [5]. In our case, pa-
tients’ coagulation status was kept normal at the time
of transferring to our burn center and the following 2
weeks, even if the patient had been suffering from se-
vere wound and bloodstream infection since PBD 13.
There were no signs of DIC, and coagulation criteria

degraded product level). When the first coagulation ab-
normalities developed on PBD 23, signs and symptoms
of severe infection had already been remitted (relief of
high fever, delirium, and wound infiltration, also blood
culture was reported negative on PBD 24), attributed to
wound debridement accompanied with effective sys-
temic antibiotic treatment, and white blood cell counts
were elevated within accepted level (10.38 × 109/L, neu-
(PLT) counts (277 × 1012/L)
trophils 85.1%). Platelet
and precalcitonin (PCT) (0.5 ng/mL) were normal, so
the possibility of thrombocytopenia and septic coagu-
lopathy was ruled out. There was no over-transfusion
or enormous blood loss during surgical procedures, and
serum calcium level was occasionally slightly decreased
(fluctuated from 1.82 to 2.05 mmol/L), which indicated
no relationship between surgical procedure, blood loss,
transfusion, and coagulopathy.

On the other hand, acquired coagulation factor defi-
ciency might be associated with systemic amyloidosis, re-
spiratory mycoplasma infection, and is extremely rare
among extensive burn patients but sporadically reported
in the literature [6–9]. It could due to the presence of an
inhibitor, anti-cardiolipin antibody, or be related to anti-
biotic treatment, such as Meropenem®, of which the
mechanism still remained unknown. In the present case,
the patient had a negative medical or family history. The
plasma-mixing test, with resultant normalization of PT
and APTT contradicted the presence of antibody or in-
hibitor. Furthermore, not just factor X activity was at an
extremely low level (28%, normal range 50 × 150%), but
other coagulation factors related to vitamin K metabolism

factor IX, and coagulation factor X activities were 39%,

of these factors presenting with increased PT or APTT
and clinically manifested with bleeding. Serum concentra-
tion of phylloquinone (vitamin K1), vitamin K1 2,3-Epox-
ide (K1O), and protein induced by vitamin K absence or
antagonist II (PIVKA-II) can be measured; however, the
diagnosis is usually clinical and by exclusion [11]. Dietary
insufficiency and long-term broad-spectrum antibiotic
therapy could be the reason for VKD among critically ill
patients. For our patient, the first possibility was easy to
be ruled out since normal diet and supplemental GI nutri-
tion out-reached 65 μg/day, the recommended nutrient
intake of vitamin K by the World Health Organization for
adult males [12] or the daily requirement of 100 mg phyl-
loquinone
of
hemostasis [13]. Vitamin K can be obtained not only from
digestive food, but also synthesized by intestinal bacterial
flora colonizing in the colon or the distal ileum (vitamin
K2, menaquinone-MK), that is activated in the liver [14].
In our opinion, patients’ hepatic function tests kept nor-
mal when he was hospitalized. No cholestasis or hepatic
pathological entities found, which rejected the hypothesis
of vitamin K recycle interdiction. Therefore, came the
high suspicion of broad-spectrum antibiotics as the reason
for secondary VKD that led to hypocoagulopathy in this
case.

the maintenance

Antibiotic-induced secondary VKD can develop by the
following possible mechanisms: the first is the inhibition
of vitamin K metabolism in the liver. Cephalosporins,
which include the N-methylthiotetrazole (NMTT) side
chain (e.g., cefmetazole, cefotetan, cefamandole, cefoper-
azone, and moxalactam) or the 2-methyl− 1,3,4-thiadia-
zole-5-thiol
side chain (e.g., cefazolin), may inhibit
vitamin K epoxide reductase in the vitamin K metabol-
ism cycles and makes it accumulated in the liver. Usu-
ally, patients on parenteral nutrition are at stake of the

risk [15]. Low plasma vitamin K1 concentration can en-
sure the co-relationship between antibiotic application
and secondary VKD. It was reported that the average
time from the initiation of antibiotic therapy to diagnosis
of hypoprothrombinemia was 5.7 days (range, 2–15
days), and patients’ prognosis was well after being ad-
ministered vitamin K supplements [16]. Obviously, this
was not the key in our case since no cephalosporins had
been applied. The second mechanism of antibiotic-in-
duced VKD is that broad-spectrum antibiotics suppress
intestinal flora that synthesize vitamin K2 (menaquino-
ne-MK), which might play the causative role in our case
leading to the clinical manifestation of bleeding. Mero-
penem®
is the bactericide of which the anti-bacterial
spectrum covers Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria
(including Pseudomonas), and anaerobic bacteria. There
was the report that Meropenem® induced the transient
coagulation factor X deficiency of a 12-month-old boy
suffering from 25% TBSA and underwent hypocoagul-
ability 3 days after the initiation of the antibiotic. And it
is also considered to be responsible for drug-induced
immune thrombocytopenia (DITP)
that shows acute
thrombocytopenia in patients [17]. The mechanism of
Meropenem® to initiate different ways of coagulopathy
still needs further investigation; however, in present case
treatment, long-term usage of Meropenem® might eradi-
cate vitamin K producing intestinal microflora,
inter-
dicted the vitamin K2 pathway and made it deprived of
vitamin K storage in the patient. Moreover, the com-
bined application of
tigecycline might aggravate the
clearance of
intestinal microflora. Protein induced by
vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIKA-II) is the pre-
dictor of VKD in such cases. However, tests investigating
specific vitamin K concentrations that might be helpful to

vitamin
K-related-coagulation factor values after efficient dosage
of supplemental vitamin K bolus (20 mg q.d), clinical and
laboratory improvement after discontinuation of Merope-
nem® gave us the hint that long-term and high dosage of
Meropenem® application could be the cause of hypocoa-
gulopathy in this patient.

The role of tigecycline treatment in this case also merits
careful consideration. Tigecycline is a tetracycline-class
bacteriostatic agent that acts against gram-positive, gram-
negative, and anaerobic microbes, but not Pseudomonas
spp. or Proteus spp. [18]. Coagulation disturbances were
observed only as an interaction between tigecycline and
warfarin. Few, but severe cases of hypofibrinogenemia that
related to tigecycline treatment were reported and high
dosage of the drug or combination with warfarin could be
the risk factors [19, 20]. The mechanism by which tigecyc-
line provokes coagulation disturbance could either relate
to the reduction of intestinal microflora or direct on vita-
min K activation in the liver. In our case, tigecycline was
used to act against the multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella
pneumonia with recommended dosage, and later com-
bined with fosfomycin sodium when the wound culture
proved that the strain shift from medium to resistant to
tigecycline. It could have acted synergic with Meropenem®
in eradicating intestinal micro-organisms, also according
to Naranjo scale [21], which investigates the probability of
adverse drug reactions (ADR), indicated that tigecycline
could be the doubtful cause for hypocoagulopathy, while
Meropenem® might be the possible one. No coagulation
disturbance occurred after the re-administration of tige-
cycline in the case even supplemental vitamin K bolus had
been withdrawn at that time.

Conclusions
Hypocoagulopathy may be devoted to different rea-
sons other than sepsis in extensive burns. Early rec-
ognition of the cause for coagulation disturbance is
critical to make appropriate treatment and save pa-
tients’ lives. Extensive burn patients are vulnerable to
secondary VKD related to broad-spectrum antibiotic
treatment, but treatable if early supplemental vitamin
K is applied. We recommend coagulation parameters
be closely monitored and to withdraw antibiotics ap-
plication as soon as possible. The exact mechanisms
of Meropenem®
to impair activation of coagulation
factors and why there was only endogenous pathway
impairment in this case remained to be further eluci-
dated; the potential role of genetic susceptibility could
be one way out.
