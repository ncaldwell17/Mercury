Background. Globally, anemia, among people living with HIV/AIDS, is a major public health problem. It has a significant effect
on the progression of HIV/AIDS to advanced stages and there are a number of factors that often affect anemia. However, there is
little insight regarding factors affecting anemia among HIV/AIDS patients in developing countries, including Ethiopia. Objective.
This study aimed at investigating factors affecting anemia among people living with HIV/AIDS taking ART drug at Tikur Anbessa
Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods. A hospital based cross-sectional study design was used to assess factors
affecting anemia among people living with HIV/AIDS. Structured checklist was used to gather information from charts of patients
selected by simple random sampling method. We analyzed the data to identify factors associated with anemia among people with
HIV/AIDS using logistic regression models. Results. A total of 301 selected charts were reviewed. The median age was 38 ¬± 10.38.
The majority (62.5%) of the patients were taking ZDV-containing ART drug (ZDV/3TC/NVP). The overall anemia prevalence was
34.6%, while about 5%, 15.6%, and 14% of the patients had severe, moderate, and mild prevalence of anemia, respectively. Factors
that were found to affect anemia among these patients include gender (OR = 2.26 [95% CI: 1.22, 4.16]), occupation (OR: 0.57 [95%CI:
0.35, 0.92]), WBC count (OR = 2.30 [95% CI: 1.29, 4.09]), platelet count (OR = 2.89 [95% CI: 0.99, 8.41]), nutritional status (OR
= 2.05 [95% CI: 0.69, 6.02]), and WHO clinical stage of HIV/AIDS (OR = 3.69 [95% CI: 1.86, 7.31]). Conclusions. About one in
three patients was found to be anemic. Intervention aimed at diagnosing and treating anemia among people living with HIV/AIDS
should be considered.

1. Introduction

Anemia is a major public health problem, especially in
developing countries [1‚Äì3]. It has significant consequences on
health and social and economic development of individuals
[4]. The most common causes of anemia are deficiency of
mineral, iron, and vitamin B12 [5], infestation of hookworm,
malaria infection, vitamin A deficiency, genetic defects, and
chronic infections like TB and HIV [6].

Undeniably, anemia is the most important clinical prob-
lem seen in people living with HIV/AIDS [7]; its severity
increases as CD4 count declines [8] and with progression
of the disease HIV/AIDS to advanced stage [9]. In addition,
the higher anemia level by itself is also a good opportunity
for progression of HIV/AIDS irrespective of CD4 counts
level and viral load [10]. Moreover, anemia influences the

natural history of the disease HIV/AIDS [11], resulting in the
decrease of the survival rate. A number of previous studies
from developing countries have demonstrated this evidence
[12, 13].

HIV leads to declining the production of cytokine, which
ultimately influences hematopoiesis process of the cells,
specifically erythropoietin concentration [11]. This, in turn,
results in ineffective/decreased production of red blood cells
and/or increases their destruction [14]. The most common
factors related to the reduced production of red blood
cells are acquisition of neoplasm to bone marrow, bone
marrow infection due to the HIV itself, administration of
myelodepressive chemotherapies like ZDV, and autoantibody
proteins produced due to chemotherapies [14, 15]. However,
a number of studies revealed that use of HAART reduces
anemia among people living with HIV/AIDS [16, 17].

Previous studies conducted in Ethiopia showed that the
prevalence of anemia among people living with HIV/AIDS
taking ART ranged from 20.9% to 70.1% [14, 18‚Äì20]. Factors
that are often associated with anemia among people living
with HIV/AIDS include ART regimen, presence of oppor-
tunistic infections (OIs), residence, gender, marital status,
monthly income, educational status, duration of ART taken,
history of antituberculosis (TB) drug treatment, advanced
stage of the HIV disease, white blood cell (WBC) count <
4,000 cells/ùúáL, CD4+T-lymphocyte count < 200 cells/ùúáL, and
platelets count < 200,000 cells/ùúáL [21‚Äì23]. However, there is
limited insight regarding the prevalence and factors associ-
ated with anemia level among people living with HIV/AIDS
taking ART drug in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The purpose of
this study was to estimate the prevalence and examine factors
associated with anemia among people living with HIV/AIDS
taking ART drug at ART clinic of Tikur Anbessa Specialized
Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

2. Methods
2.1. Study Design and Settings. A cross-sectional study design
was conducted from April 15 to May 15, 2018, at Tikur
Anbessa Specialized Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The
hospital is among referral and teaching hospitals of the
country located in Addis Ababa. The hospital has HIV/AIDS
care-providing center with an average daily client flow of
50‚Äì60.

2.2. Sample Size Determination, Sampling Procedure, and
Study Subjects. Sample size was estimated using a single pop-
ulation proportion formula and calculated with the following
assumptions: 95% confidence level, 5% margin of error, and
23% expected prevalence of anemia among people living with
HIV/AIDS [20]. Given these assumptions and considering
a nonresponse rate of 10%, the required sample size was
found to be 301. Simple random sampling method was used
to select charts to be reviewed among charts of clients who
have been followed up during the data collection period on
daily basis. Charts of client, with incomplete information,
age under 18, pregnant women, postpartum period, and
ART inexperienced (those who took ART drug for less than

three months), were excluded from the study. The most
recent data was taken as information recorded for the study
from laboratory investigation sheets and other information
sheets.

2.3. Study Variables
2.3.1. Anemia Level. The anemia level was determined based
on WHO report 2001 and a study conducted on pathogenesis
and clinical implications of HIV-related anemia in 2013;
the anemia level for nonpregnant women was defined as
hemoglobin < 12.0 g/dl: [severe < 7.0 g/dl, moderate = 7‚Äì9.9
g/dl, and mild = 10‚Äì11.9 g/dl], whereas, for men, it was defined
as hemoglobin <13.0: [severe < 9.0 g/dl, moderate = 9‚Äì11.9
g/dl, and mild = 12.0‚Äì12.9 g/dl] [24, 25].

2.3.2. Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics of the
Patients. The sociodemographic characteristics identified
from the patients‚Äô chart include age, gender, residence,
religion, ethnic group, marital status, educational status,
occupation, and monthly income. Moreover, the clinical and
biochemical test characteristics of patients gathered from
charts include CD4 count (cells/ùúáL), WBC count (cells/ùúáL),
platelet count (cells/ùúáL), nutritional status (BMI) (kg/m2),
WHO clinical stage of HIV/AIDS, ART regimen, and anti-TB
treatment history. The CD4 T-lymphocyte was determined
based on WHO (World Health Organization) recommenda-
tion of 2007 to commence ART for HIV positive peoples [26].
The WBC and platelet ranges were determined based on the
guide of Bacovsky J, blood count interpretation for health
personnel [27]. In order to assess nutritional status, patients‚Äô
body mass index was calculated as a proportion of weight
in kg divided by height squared. Then, they were indexed
based on body mass index level considered by healthcare
practitioners [28]. The clinical stage of HIV/AIDS was used
based on the WHO clinical staging classification criteria [26].
The ART regimen was determined based on whether the
study participants were taking ZDV-containing ART drug or
not. Similarly, treatment history of the client was assessed for
being treated for TB or not. Table 1 summarizes the cut-off
points used for blood cell levels.

2.4. Data Collection Instrument, Data Collection Process-
ing, and Quality Control. The questionnaire (checklist) was
developed after reviewing literatures and WHO guidelines.
The checklist comprised sociodemographic and clinical char-
acteristics: age, gender, residence, religion, ethnic group, mar-
ital status, educational status, occupation, monthly income,
and clinical characteristics: CD4 T-lymphocyte, hemoglobin,
WBC, platelet count level, BMI level, WHO clinical stage
of HIV/AIDS, ART regimen, and history to treatment for
TB. Before the actual data collection date, the question-
naire was pretested on 5% of charts of the study popula-
tion. Then, necessary modification was done based on its
analysis. The study questionnaire was prepared in English.
A graduate class nurse student collected the data. Princi-
pal orientation was given for data collector prior to the
data collection date on how to collect the data and make
them familiar with the data collection questionnaire. The
completeness of each questionnaire was checked on daily
basis.

2.5. Data Analysis. Data was entered using EpiData version
3.1 statistical package software. After thorough cleaning, the
data was exported to SPSS version 22 statistical package
software for further analysis. Descriptive statistics such as
mean, standard deviations (SD), frequency, and percentage
were used to describe the variables of the study. In order to
describe factors associated with anemia among people living
with HIV/AIDS, unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios with
their 95% CI were calculated using logistic regression models.

2.6. Ethical Consideration. The ethical clearance letter was
obtained from ethical clearance committee of Addis Ababa
University College of Health Sciences. After we offered the
letter to the head department of ART clinic, the purpose of
the study was clearly stated to the healthcare professionals
working in the ART clinic of the Hospital.

3. Results
A total of 301 charts were reviewed. The median age was
38¬±10.38. The majority (62.1%) of the study participants were
female. About half (50.5%) of the study participants were
unemployed. More than three-fourths (90%) of the study par-
ticipants were from urban residential area. About half (49.8%)
of the study participants were married. Table 2 summarizes
the details of the characteristics of study participants.

3.1. The Clinical and Biochemical Tests Characteristics. The
medians (¬±SD) of CD4, WBC, and platelet counts were
332 ¬± 195.67, 5490 ¬± 4015, and 287000 ¬± 97499.53, respec-
tively. The majority (77.1%, 68.4%, and 93.4%) of the study
participant‚Äôs CD4, WBC, and platelet count were ‚â• 200, ‚â•
4500, and ‚â• 150,000 cells/ùúáL, respectively. Regarding the
study participant‚Äôs nutritional status, 61.5%, 20.6%, 12%, and
6% of the study participants were found to be of normal
weight, overweight, underweight, and obese in their nutri-
tional status, respectively. Further, almost three-fourths of the

study participants were taking ZDV-containing ART drug
(ZDV/3TC/NVP) (Table 3).

3.2. Prevalence of Anemia. The prevalence of anemia was
34.6%. Among the overall anemic study participants, 5%,
15.6%, and 14% had severe, moderate, and mild level of
anemia, respectively. A significant number (48) of study
participants were from the age group of 30-39. A momentous
number (75 and 60) of anemic study participants had CD4
T-lymphocyte and WBC count ‚â• 200 and ‚â• 4500 cells/ùúáL,
respectively. A noteworthy number (40) of anemic study
participants were found in stage IV of WHO clinical stage
of HIV/AIDS. Regarding ART regimen and anti-TB drug
exposure history, a considerable number (60 and 36) of
anemic study participants were taking ZDV-containing ART
drug (ZDV/3TC/NVP) and had history of anti-TB drug
treatment exposure, respectively (Table 3). Among a total of
95 study participants whose WBC count level was < 4500
cells/ùúáL, 44 were anemic, while the remaining 51 were not
anemic. Moreover, among a total of 77 study participants who
were found in stage IV of WHO clinical staging of HIV/AIDS,
40 were anemic, while the remaining 37 were not. Further,
among a total of 188 study participants who were taking
ZDV-containing ART drug (ZDV/3TC/NVP), a considerable
number (60) were anemic, while the remaining 128 were not
(Figure 1).

3.3. Factors Associated with Anemia. The unadjusted logistic
regression analysis revealed that sociodemographic charac-
teristics, gender (ùúí2 = 6.89, p < 0.010) and occupation (ùúí2

(Table 2). Regarding clinical characteristics, WBC count (ùúí2
= 8.33, p < 004), platelet count (ùúí2 = 5.78, p < 0.18), nutritional
status (ùúí2 = 23.45, p < 0.001), and WHO clinical HIV/AIDS
stage (ùúí2 = 16.72, p < 0.001,) were significantly associated with
anemia (Table 3). The adjusted logistic regression analysis
showed that gender (OR = 2.26 [95% CI = 1.22, 4.16], P <
0.009), WBC count (OR = 2.30 [95% CI = 1.29, 4.09], p <

p < 0.001), and WHO clinical HIV stage (OR = 3.69 [95%
CI = 1.86, 7.31], p < 0.003) were among the different factors

associated with anemia among people living with HIV/AIDS
(Table 4).

4. Discussion
This study assessed the prevalence and factors associated with
anemia among people living with HIV/AIDS taking ART for
at least three months in Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital
in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It is clear that anemia is a common
medical problem affecting people living with HIV/AIDS by
complicating the pathogenesis of the disease [9, 19, 25]. Using
anemia demarcation level < 13 g/dl [24, 25], our study found

that the prevalence of anemia was 34.6%. This figure is lower
when compared to previous studies completed in Ethiopia
(the prevalence ranged from 43% to 70.1%) [9, 14, 22], Iran,
Nigeria, China, and Nepal, ranging between 51.5 and 71%
[13, 29‚Äì33]. However, the prevalence of anemia reported in
this study was higher than a number of studies conducted in
different parts of Ethiopia ranging between 20.8 and 23.1%
[18, 20, 21, 34‚Äì37] and South Africa (25.8%) [10]. Moreover,

this study revealed that 5%, 15.6%, and 14% of the study
participants had severe, moderate, and mild level of anemia,
respectively. This finding is in line for the severe level of
anemia while it is lower for moderate and mild level of anemia
in another study from Ethiopia [36]. The possible reason
for the difference observed in prevalence of anemia may be
due to the difference in socioeconomic level, difference in
study participants‚Äô WHO clinical HIV/AIDS staging level,

6

Advances in Hematology

difference in ART regimen taking, presence/absence and/or
level of opportunistic infections, lack of awareness about
appropriate nutrition, and inclusion and/or exclusion criteria
in recruiting study participants.

The finding of this study indicates that almost one-third
of the study participants were anemic, which is a concern,
as untreated anemia in people living with HIV/AIDS and/or
taking ART is associated with pathophysiologic changes and
progression of the disease to advanced stage and finally may
result in death of the individual [25]. Thus, there should be an
intervention that has an ultimate effect in reducing mortality
related to complications of anemia among people living with
HIV/AIDS and/or taking ART drug.

Factors associated with anemia include gender, occu-
pation, WBC count, platelet count, nutritional status, and
WHO clinical staging level. These findings are partly in line
with similar previous study findings [9, 11, 18, 21]. According
to the findings of this study, females were more likely to
be anemic compared to males. This finding is in line with
studies from Nigeria and South Africa [10, 29]. However, the
unemployed study participants were less likely to be anemic
compared to the employed study participants. Similarly,
younger study participants were found to be less likely to be
anemic compared to the elders. This finding is in line with
studies from Ethiopia [10, 14]. This may be due to the fact
that the younger study participants‚Äô cell proliferating organs
have more competent proliferation capacity of red blood cell
and the participants themselves are more aware about benefit
of consuming more nutritional diet and/or have a better
socioeconomic and educational status.

Moreover, we found that underweight study participants
were more likely to be anemic, while those with normal
weight were less likely to be anemic. This finding is consistent
with previous studies conducted in developing countries [10,
12, 38]. This may be due to the fact that the underweight
individuals are less aware about the benefit of appropriate
nutrition consumption and/or have a less socioeconomic and
educational condition or may have less adherence to ART
drug therapy. Further, those study participants taking ZDV-
containing ART drug were found more likely to be anemic
compared to those who were not. This finding is in line with
similar studies from Ethiopia [11, 13, 20, 35]. This is usually
due to the side effect of the ART drug ZDV resulting in
manifestation of granulocytopenia, anemia, malaise, fatigue,
and other gastrointestinal symptoms [39].

Bearing in mind the effect of anemia and its significant
prevalence, it is a great disquiet that more than one-third of
the study participants were anemic, while appropriate treat-
ment options are available and the study participants were
on ART drug for at least three months, which have an effect
to combat the pathogenesis of the disease. Therefore, based
on the findings of this study, the following interventions are
suggested to detect and combat anemia among people living
with HIV/AIDS taking ART drug. (1) Monitor hemoglobin
level on each of the follow-up periods by focusing on
those people taking ART drug regimen containing ZDV
and take appropriate action to combat the anemia if anemia
is detected. This is because the pathogenesis of anemia is
worrisome and ZDV by itself has an effect on reducing

proliferation of red blood cells. (2) Monitor adherence level
of the people living with HIV/AIDS taking ART drug to their
therapy and motivate, encourage, and advise them to adhere
to the ART drug therapy consistently to gain its therapeutic
effect. This is because ART drug has an effect on combating
anemia among people living with HIV/AIDS taking ART
drug. (3) Monitor and take quick appropriate action for drug-
drug interaction and magnified side effects of each drug
which may occur in people living with HIV/AIDS taking
ART drug. This is because drug-drug interaction and side
effects of some drugs by themselves interfere with reduced
proliferation of granulocytes and contribute to raising imma-
ture destruction of cells. (4) Increase awareness of people
living with HIV/AIDS taking ART drug about the benefit
of adhering to consumption of nutritional diet consistently.
This is because consuming appropriate diet helps the body
in proliferating enough amounts of red blood cells and other
granulocytes. This study has limitations. Firstly, it is a cross-
sectional study that has chicken egg dilemma in identifying
causal relationship. Secondly, the study excludes people living
with HIV/AIDS who are na¬®ƒ±ve to ART drug. Thus, it is
recommended that future study considers longitudinal study
by considering ART-na¬®ƒ±ve people living with HIV/AIDS by
determining the severity of anemia.

In conclusion, it is important to alleviate anemia among
people living with HIV/AID taking ART drug, as the
presence of anemia among people living with HIV/AIDS
fastens the progression of the disease to the advanced
stages. The suggested intervention by this study focused at
improving nutritional status of people living with HIV/AIDS
taking ART drug through enhancing awareness of benefit
of consuming balanced diet and monitoring and managing
granulocytes level appropriately, which increases survival
rate; it is best to monitor granulocytes like CD4 count, platelet
and WBC count, and hemoglobin level more frequently. It is
also good to focus on sociodemographic characteristics like
gender and occupation of the client, which have an ultimate
effect in affecting level of anemia among people living with
HIV/AIDS.
