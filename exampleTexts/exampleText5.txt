Background. Abnormalities in lung function tests have been shown to commonly occur in a majority of patients with sickle cell
disease (SCD) even at steady state. The prevalence and pattern of these lung function abnormalities have been described in other
populations but this is unknown among our sickle cell cohort. There is generally little information available on risk factors associated
with the lung function abnormalities and its relevance in patient care. Method. This was an analytical cross-sectional study involving
76 clinically stable, hydroxyurea-naive adult Hb-SS participants and 76 nonsickle cell disease (non-SCD) controls. A structured
questionnaire was used to obtain sociodemographic data and clinical history of the participants. Investigations performed included
spirometry, pulse oximetry, tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) measurements via echocardiogram, complete blood counts, free
plasma haemoglobin, serum urea, and creatinine. Results. Weight, BMI, mean FVC, and FEV1% predicted values were comparatively
lower among the Hb-SS patients (p < 0.001). Abnormal spirometry outcome occurred in 70.4% of Hb-SS patients, predominantly
restrictive defects (p < 0.001), and showed no significant association with steady-state Hb, WBC count, free plasma haemoglobin,
frequency of sickling crisis, chronic leg ulcers, and TRV measurements (p > 0.05). The mean oxygen saturation was comparatively
lower among Hb-SS patients (p < 0.001). Conclusion. Measured lung volumes were significantly lower in Hb-SS patients when
compared to non-SCD controls and this difference was not influenced by anthropometric variance. Lung function abnormalities,
particularly restrictive defects, are prevalent in Hb-SS patients but showed no significant association with recognized markers of
disease severity.

1. Introduction

The lung is one of the major organs affected by sickle
cell disease (SCD) being a common site of hypoxic and
ischaemic injury and emboli from marrow infarcts/fat necro-
sis and is plagued with increased propensity for developing
pneumonias [1–3]. Acute and chronic lung complications
in sickle cell disease are major causes of morbidity and
mortality, accounting for 20-30% of all sickle cell deaths [1, 4].
Chronic complications could manifest as abnormalities in
lung function, interstitial lung disease, or pulmonary hyper-
tension. Lung function abnormalities have been shown to

commonly occur in a majority of SCD patients even at steady
state and these include lower lung volumes (FEV1/FVC),
decreased diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide, airway
hyperresponsiveness/asthma, and hypoxaemia [5, 6]. The
reported prevalence of these lung function abnormalities is
varied [7–11]. Although early stages of these lung function
abnormalities are usually asymptomatic, a significant number
of SCD patients may have dyspnoea on exertion with reduced
exercise capacity when severe [12]. A recent study found an
association between low FEV1 and increased risk of mortality
among adults with Hb-SS [13]. Powars et al. had earlier
suggested that abnormalities in lung function tests could be

2

the first objective sign of sickle cell chronic lung disease and
could reduce morbidity when detected early through screen-
ing [10]. The current study therefore sought to determine the
prevalence and pattern of lung function abnormalities among
a cohort of adult Hb-SS patients compared to healthy non-
SCD controls and identify associated factors.

2. Methods
This was an analytical cross-sectional study carried out
between March and June 2014. The study was conducted
at the Ghana Institute of Clinical Genetics which houses
the sickle cell clinic of the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital,
a major referral site for the Accra Metropolis. The study
sample consisted of 76 randomly selected Hb-SS adults, 18
years and above from the out-patient unit of the sickle
cell clinic who were in their steady state with results of
electrophoresis clearly documented in their medical records.
Seventy-six-year-old and sex matched non-SCD controls
were selected from among the healthcare staff of the above
hospital.

A structured questionnaire was used to collect partici-
pants' sociodemographic and medical information after writ-
ten consent was obtained. Anthropometric measurements
such as weight, height, and BMI were taken as well as blood
pressure, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation using Omron
digital BP machine (Intelli Sense R) and ChoiceMMED
brand pulse oximeter, respectively. A modified version of St.
George’s Respiratory questionnaire was used to screen the
participants for symptoms of chronic respiratory diseases and
excluded if present. General cardiorespiratory examination
was performed on all participants to further exclude res-
piratory, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal abnormalities
that were capable of influencing the spirometry or echocar-
diogram results. Spirometry was performed and interpreted
for all participants according to American Thoracic Society
(ATS) protocol using SCHILLER SPIROVIT SP-1 (Schiller-
AG, Switzerland) [14]. The best of three FEV1 and FVC
test value from acceptable and reproducible maneuvers was
recorded as both absolute and percentage predicted values.
Abnormal FEV1 or FVC% predicted was defined as values <
80% of predicted values. For the purposes of this research,
a forceful blow of ≥ 3sec was considered an acceptable blow
for interpretation and analysis [9]. Blood samples taken were
analysed for complete blood count, urea, and creatinine
and free plasma haemoglobin (a marker of intravascular
hemolysis). For the latter, solid phase-phase sandwich ELISA
technique was used and optimization was predetermined
prior to running the test sample. Values >40ug/ml were
regarded as abnormal and suggestive of ongoing intravascular
haemolysis [3]. Patients underwent transthoracic echocar-
diogram which was performed by a consultant cardiologist
using a Toshiba brand ECHO machine, Aplio 300 3MHz
transducer in accordance with the American echocardiog-
raphy society guidelines [15]. The average of three different
TRV measurements was recorded as the mean TRV value,
where values ≥ 2.5m/s were classified as elevated TRV
[16].

2.1. Study Definitions. Steady state: absence of acute painful
events or hemolytic episodes 4 weeks prior to recruitment as
well as no hemotransfusion within the same specified period.
Sickle cell crisis: sickle cell crisis was defined as acute
painful episodes that required use of oral or intravenous
analgesics and led to ER or daycare visits with or without
hospitalization.

Severity of disease: for the purpose of this study disease
severity was defined as (1) having 3 or more acute painful
episodes in the past one year prior to study [17]; (2) history
of chronic leg ulcer (3) history of priapism; (4) elevated TRV
on ECHO.

Data analysis was done using Statistical Package for
Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22. ANOVA was used to
compare FVC and FEV1% predicted values among the
study participants as well as comparing means of labora-
tory indices between Hb-SS participants with normal and
abnormal spirometry outcomes. Spearman’s rank correlation
and Dunnett’s pairwise post hoc analysis were used to
establish relationships between spirometry and laboratory
measurements. Chi-square test was employed to compare
proportions of spirometry outcomes among relevant cate-
gories of respondents. Linear regression and multivariate
analysis were used to examine significant factors influencing
spirometry outcomes.

Approval was obtained from the Ethical and Protocol
Review Committee of the College of Health sciences, Univer-
sity of Ghana (protocol identification number CHS-Et/M.10-
P3.9/2013-2014).

3. Results
Table 1 shows the age and gender distribution as well as
anthropometric characteristics of the participants. The mean
age for the Hb-SS participants was 33.8 ± 11.1 years with
majority (60.5%) being females. The mean weight and BMI of
Hb-SS participants were 59±13.2kg and 21.8±4.2, respectively,
compared to 69.1± 14.5kg and 25.1± 4.8, respectively, among
the controls (p < 0.001). Both groups had comparable mean
height of 164. 3±cm and 166.1 ± cm, respectively (p = 0.077).

3.1. Clinical History of the Hb-SS Subjects. Out of the 76
participants, 6 (7.9%) had associated hypertension, only 1
(1.3%) had diabetes, and 1(1.3%) had chronic kidney dis-
ease (CKD). Fifty-three (69.7%) had a history of previous
blood transfusion and 28 (36.8%) had a history of chronic
(present/past/recurrent) leg ulcers. Nine (25.7%) out of the
30 males had a previous history of priapism, mostly in the
adolescent period. Sixty-three (82.9%) had at most 2 episodes
of vasoocclusive (VOC) crisis in the year prior to the study,
while 13 (17.1%) had 3 or more episodes over the past year.

3.2. Lung Function Parameters of Hb-SS Compared to Non-
SCD Controls. Five Hb-SS participants and 2 of the controls
had poor spirometry tests (forceful blow duration less than
3secs); thus their results were not included in the analysis.
From Table 1, the mean FVC and FEV1% predicted of the Hb-
SS patients were 72.6 ± 22.2% and 65.3 ± 20.6%, respectively,

compared to 90.4±11.9% and 87±12.8% among the controls
(p < 0.001). Analysis showed that 53 (74.6%) and 43 (60.6%)
of the Hb-SS participants had abnormal FEV1% and FVC%
predicted, respectively (<80%).

Table 2 showed that FEV1 and FVC% predicted values
positively correlated with the age, height, weight, and BMI
of the participants but these were not statistically significant
except for weight and BMI (p<0.05). Gender was also
significantly associated with participants FEV1% predicted
(p=0.010).

Logistic regression analysis however showed that age,
height, gender, weight, and BMI did not significantly influ-
ence the presence or absence of abnormal FEV1 and FVC%
predicted (Table 3). Also, the odds of having abnormal FEV%
and FVC% predicted among the cases were 11.7 and 13.2,
respectively (Table 3).

As shown in Table 4, 50(70.4%) of Hb-SS patients com-
pared to 9(12.2%) of the controls had abnormal spirome-
try outcome (defined as restrictive, obstructive, or mixed

restrictive and obstructive defects; p < 0.001). The propor-
tions of abnormal spirometry outcomes among the Hb-SS
participants were restrictive (70%), obstructive (16%), and
mixed defects (14%), while the controls all had restrictive
defects only. The mean oxygen saturation was 94.0±1.9%
on room air compared to 97±1.6% among the controls (p
< 0.001). There was no significant difference between the
mean oxygen saturation of Hb-SS participants with normal
or abnormal spirometry outcome.

3.3. Association between Laboratory Parameters and Spirom-
etry Outcome of Hb-SS Participants. The mean steady-state
haemoglobin of the Hb-SS participants was 8.1 ± 1.6g/dl with
a range of 4.90 – 11.2 g/dl. The mean total WBC was elevated
(10.1 ± 3.6 x 109/l) with a range of 3.4–26 x109/l. The mean
platelet count was normal 341.4 ± 109.2 x109/l showing a wide
range of 143-873 x 109/l. Mean blood urea was normal, 3.5 ± 1.6
mmols/l with a mean creatinine of 55.6 ± 20.0 mmols/l. Mean

free plasma haemoglobin was elevated, 105.7 ± 53.4𝜇g/ml
with 66 (91.7%) of the patients having values > 40 𝜇g/ml,
indicative of intravascular haemolysis.

From analysis, abnormal spirometry outcome was sig-
nificantly associated with blood urea level (p=033) but not
with serum creatinine (p=0.056). A positive correlation was
observed between FEV1% predicted and haemoglobin level;
R=0.239; p = 0.043 (Table 5). We also found that free plasma
Hb levels > 40𝜇g/ml was significantly associated with FEV1%
(p= 0.031). However when other laboratory factors were
accounted for using linear multivariate regression analysis,
none of the laboratory factors including Hb, urea, and
free plasma Hb were significantly associated with FEV1%
predicted. Comparing laboratory parameters among the
Hb-SS participants with various spirometry defects, total
platelet count appeared to be significantly lower in those
with obstructive defects; p=0.034 (Table 6). Further post hoc
analysis for pairwise comparison using Dunnett’s test showed
that only obstructive and restrictive defects were nearly
significantly different (p=0.05), suggesting a lower platelet
count among patients with obstructive defects.

Also, TRV, a noninvasive marker of elevated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure showed a tendency to be compara-
tively elevated in those with mixed restrictive and obstructive
defect (p=0.056). However, there was no significant associa-
tion between TRV and percentage predicted values of FEV1
and FVC (Table 7).

3.4. Spirometry Measurements and Associated Clinical Factors.
Hb-SS participants with ≥ 3 sickle cell crisis in the past
year had a lower mean FVC% predicted (65.9%) compared
to a mean of 75.0% in those with ≤ 2 crisis in the past
year (p=0.180). There were no significant differences between

participants with or without history of chronic leg ulcer with
regard to their FVC and FEV1% predicted values.

4. Discussion
4.1. Participants’ Demographic Characteristics. Generally,
children as well as adults with sickle cell disease are believed
to be of a lower average body weight and height than their
unaffected peers [18–20]. A study by Oguntoye et al. in
Nigeria reported that, until the age of 18, the trend in height
and weight of children with sickle cell disease is identical to
that of their unaffected peers but began to show significant
differences after 18 years [21]. They also showed that the gap
in anthropometric measurements between the two groups
further widened with increasing age. On the other hand,
some studies have found no significant height variation
among SCD patients 18 years and above when compared to
healthy controls, in fact reporting average or above average
heights [22, 23]. The current study similarly showed that the
Hb-SS subjects were comparable in height to the controls but
had significantly lower body weight and BMI. The negative
effect of sickle cell disease on growth and development,
especially during the adolescence period, has been blamed
for this variance; however, the role of nutrition cannot be
overlooked [24]. Incidentally the average BMI of our Hb-
SS participants (21.30) was comparable to that of the Hb-SS
participants (21.80) in a US study by Klings et al. [9]. This
could imply comparable nutritional status of the Ghanaian
Hb-SS patients to that of the American cohort but improved
holistic medical care of sickle cell patients in our part of the
world, especially during early childhood, could also influence
this pattern.

4.2. Spirometry Parameters and Anthropometry of Partici-
pants. The current study showed that measured lung vol-
umes (FEV1 and FVC% predicted) were significantly lower
in Hb-SS patients compared to the non-SCD controls and
this is consistent with findings from previous studies [6, 22,
25]. Age, gender, standing height, and weight are important
determinants of lung function due to their significant correla-
tion with Pulmonary Function Tests and this correlation has
similarly been shown in our study [26]. With the established
disparity in anthropometric parameters particularly weight,
BMI, and sometimes height, it is believed that the observed

the presence of the disease predisposes to abnormal lung
function. These suggest that reduced lung volumes in Hb-
SS patients comparative to non-SCD controls may result
from a combination of factors/complications of the disease
and not merely due to anthropometric variance although
the latter may be contributing to it. It can be inferred from
this analysis that the mere presence of Hb-SS is a significant
predictor of abnormal
lung function. Some studies have
reported diminished respiratory muscle strength in children
and young adults with SCD which could also partly explain
the lower lung volumes [28, 29].

lower lung volumes in SCD patients is largely a result of this
disparity and not necessarily pathological [27]. In addition,
Miller and Sergeant proposed that, aside from the anthro-
pometric variance, SCD patients have a relatively small chest
wall compared to their body size (disproportionate chest wall
growth) which is believed to partly contribute to the observed
decrease in lung volumes [27]. The suggested reason for the
disproportionate chest wall growth was repeated infarctions
in the ribs, sternum, and vertebra that impair optimal skeletal
growth and development.

In the current study, however, multiple regression analysis
showed that the significant variance in weight and BMI
could not explain the observed wide differences in lung
function measurements between the Hb-SS participants and
the controls. Also the odds of having an abnormal FEV1
and FVC% predicted in Hb-SS patients were about 12 and
13 times, respectively, the risk in the healthy group meaning

4.3. Prevalence of Abnormal Spirometry among Hb-SS Patients
and Associated Factors. The study found that a significant
proportion (70.4%) of the Hb-SS participants had abnormal
spirometry outcome, with restrictive defect being predom-
inant. In a US study by Klings et al., as much as 90%
of the Hb-SS participants had abnormal
lung function
including 13% with impaired DLco [9]. Our proportion was
comparatively lower and this could be due to our inability
to test for diffusion capacity (DLco). Similar to our study,
Dosunmu and colleagues in Nigeria found that 68% of
the SCD participants had abnormal spirometry outcome, of
which 53% had restrictive defects, 3.7% obstructive defects
and 11% with mixed defects [8]. These consistent results
more prove the predominance of restrictive defects among
adults with sickle cell disease [6–9, 30, 31]. Abnormal lung
function, particularly, restrictive defects in Hb-SS, has been
shown to be more prevalent in those with a severe disease

pattern evident by recurrent vasoocclusive crisis and ACS,
lower haemoglobin, raised markers of haemolysis, chronic
leg ulcers, renal dysfunction, and raised pulmonary arterial
pressures/pulmonary hypertension [5, 6, 16, 32].

A prospective study by Aquino and colleagues reported
a significant correlation between the severity and extent
of parenchymal abnormalities on chest CT-scan and the
number of prior ACS [33]. Maioli and colleagues in Brazil
also found an association between a history of ACS and
restrictive defects on spirometry [34]. In our study, we
were unable to obtain a definite history of ACS due to
diagnostic challenges that existed but observed that patients
with increased frequency of crisis (3 or more in the past
year), largely VOC in nature, had lower FVC % predicted
values when compared to those with 2 or less episodes of
sickle cell crisis in a year (65.9% predicted versus 75.0%
predicted, respectively; p=0.180). This supports the notion
that recurrent VOC crisis could cause ischaemic damage
to the lung parenchyma with fibrosis via the release of
inflammatory mediators from the damaged endothelium and
hypoxic lung and hence the decrease in lung volumes [35,
36]. Obstructive defects, however, have been reported to be
more prevalent among children with SCD in whom asthma-
like symptoms and airway hyperreactivity could occur [37,
38]. The study by Klings et al. [9] and Dosunmu et al. [8]
found low prevalence of obstructive defects in the adult SCD
population studied. In contrast, Vendramini and colleagues
[25] however reported a high prevalence (31%) of obstruction
and airway hyperreactivity among adults with SCD. Our
proportion of adult SCA patients with obstructive defects was
16% which was similar to 19.5% observed by Williams et al.
[6]. The causes of obstruction in SCD are more complex and
quite unclear but thought to include inflammation, effects of
hypoxia, and oxidative stress on the bronchial tree [25].

Sickle cell vasculopathy is a complication in SCD
attributed to the toxic effects of products of intravascular
haemolysis and has been linked to the development of
pulmonary hypertension, chronic leg ulcers, chronic kidney
disease, and chronic lung complications in sickle cell patients
[39, 40]. Similar to the above observation, our analysis
showed that free plasma Hb levels above 40ug/ml, evident
of intravascular haemolysis, were significantly associated
with abnormal FEV1% predicted (< 80% predicted) and this
was consistent with findings by Sylvester et al. who found
an association between FEV1% predicted and markers of
haemolysis among SCD patients [41]. We also found that
steady-state haemoglobin showed a positive correlation with
FEV1% predicted but Williams and colleagues rather found
an association between steady-state Hb and FVC % predicted;
p < 0.001 [6, 42]. However on linear multivariate analysis, Hb
or free plasma haemoglobin significantly predicted abnormal
FEV1%.

Our study also showed a significant association between
abnormal spirometry outcome and blood urea level (p =
0.033) with a rising trend of creatinine level in those with
abnormal spirometry (p = 0.056). These observations support
suggestions from previous studies of a possible common aeti-
ological link between chronic lung disease and kidney disease
in SCD, likely through sickle cell associated vasculopathy [9].

It has been proposed that activated white blood cells and
platelets promote vascular inflammation and vessel damage.
They are therefore likely to play a role in initiating sickle
cell vasculopathy and hence the development of perivascular
lung parenchymal fibrosis with effects on measured lung
volumes [35]. Dosunmu and colleagues reported a negative
correlation between total WBC and platelet counts with the
FVC% predicted among the studied SCD cohort [8]. We
observed that the mean platelet count had a tendency to
be lower among those with obstructive defects (p =0.05).
Studies by Gladwin et al. and Anthi et al. have shown
that SCD patients with raised pulmonary artery systolic
pressure usually show a restrictive pattern on spirometry
[16, 43]. We have shown that TRV had a tendency to be
higher in Hb-SS patients with spirometry defects, particu-
larly in those with mixed defects (TRV of 2.6 ± 0.4; p =
0.056).

In conclusion, the current study has shown that lung
volumes are significantly lower in Hb-SS patients when
compared to non-SCD controls. The mere presence of the
disease strongly predicts abnormal lung function. With the
high prevalence of lung function abnormalities among Hb-
SS patients, one may suggest that the former could itself be
considered a marker of disease severity and hence periodic
screening with spirometry may be necessary to allow for
patient categorization and further management.
