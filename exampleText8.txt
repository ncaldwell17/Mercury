ABSTRACT

Background and Purpose: We aimed to elucidate independent predictors of adverse 
outcomes in caregivers of patients with dementia using readily available clinical and 
demographic data of patients with dementia and their caregivers.
Methods: We reviewed patient-caregiver data from the Clinical Research Center for Dementia 
of South Korea and Caregivers of Alzheimer Disease Research study. The clinical factors 
of the patients and the demographics of both patients and caregivers were used to predict 
adverse outcomes for caregivers. Correlation and linear regression analyses were performed.
Results: We enrolled 454 patients and their caregivers for the present study. The general 
burden for the caregiver was higher amongst female caregivers, patients with further 
decreased the level of activities of daily living (ADL), patients with more abnormal behavior, 
or younger patients. The time spent by the caregivers was more in cases of patients with 
higher Caregiver Administered Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores, younger patients and for 
patients with decreased level of ADL. Depression amongst caregivers was more prominent in 
patients with higher Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes scores. Physical health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) was lower in female caregivers, more physically affected patients, and 
older caregivers. Lastly, mental HRQoL was lower in younger, more physically affected, and in 
patients with abnormal behaviors.
Conclusions: Clinical and demographic characteristics of patients and caregivers predict 
adverse outcomes for caregivers. Therefore, these factors should be considered to provide 
support to both patients and their caregivers.

INTRODUCTION

Patients with dementia experience a gradual and progressive cognitive, functional, and 
behavioral decline, which may lead to a significant need for support from family caregivers. 
In our aging society, there is an increasing prevalence of dementia and a corresponding 
increase in the number of caregivers and social burden of caring. Although sometimes 
rewarding, caring for patients with dementia is usually very stressful, and caregivers 
experience high levels of physical and psychological morbidity.1-3 As the disease progresses,

caregivers often have to manage the increasing complexity of multiple care challenges, which 
can affect their own well-being.4 Therefore, it is necessary to consider problems experienced 
by the caregivers who act as primary carers for patients with dementia.

Numerous studies have focused on adverse outcomes and their predictors in caregivers for 
patients with dementia. One of the most studied adverse outcomes is the caregiver burden, 
which is usually evaluated with structured questionnaires such as the Zarit Burden Interview 
(ZBI).1 Other adverse outcomes, such as decreased mental and physical health-related quality 
of life (HRQoL), increased time spent in caring, and depressive mood may also result from 
caregiving.5-7 Regarding the predictors of adverse outcomes, factors associated with patients and 
their caregivers should be considered comprehensively. Specific symptoms of dementia have been 
frequently highlighted as causes of adverse outcomes of caregiving, including severity of cognitive 
dysfunction, neuropsychiatric presentation, and decreased ability to perform daily activities.6,8-10 
Furthermore, factors associated with caregivers including age, sex, personality, religiosity, 
depression, and physical conditions may also play a role in causing adverse outcomes of 
caregiving.11-13 However, in clinical settings, it is difficult to consider the caregiver's characteristics 
except for basic demographics such as age and sex. Therefore, for physicians, it seems to be 
useful to develop simplified models to predict various adverse outcomes of caregiving using 
readily available data such as the patient's clinical characteristics, and caregiver's age and sex.

In the present study, we investigated the patient's and caregiver's factors associated with 
adverse outcomes in caregivers of patients with dementia. The outcomes considered included 
the burden on caregiver, mental and physical quality of life, time spent in caring, and 
depression. We aimed to elucidate independent predictors for each adverse outcome.

METHODS

Participants
We reviewed data from the Caregivers of Alzheimer Disease Research (CARE) study. The CARE 
study was a sub-study of the Clinical Research Center for Dementia of South Korea study, a 
nationwide multicenter cohort study conducted at university-affiliated hospitals.13,14 The CARE 
survey was conducted in 2012 during visits to caregivers of patients from 12 participating 
centers in South Korea. Participants were 476 primary caregivers of patients living at home who 
had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or subcortical vascular dementia. We excluded 
patients who had been inpatients or who lived in a residential care home.

The primary caregiver was defined as the patient's family member who spent most of the time 
in taking care of the patient. These caregivers were interviewed by trained nurses or surveyors 
and completed self-report questionnaires in the outpatient clinic or their caregiver's home. 
Twenty-two cases were excluded due to incomplete data. Apparently, data from 454 patients 
and their primary caregivers were included in the statistical analyses. Written informed 
consent was obtained from all the participants, and ethical approval was obtained from the 
Institutional Review Boards at each participating hospital (AJIRB-MED-SUR-12-046).

Assessments of patients with dementia
Patient factors associated with adverse outcomes for caregivers included cognitive function, 
the severity of dementia, daily living performance, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Cognitive 
dysfunction was evaluated with the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination

(K-MMSE),15 while the severity of dementia was evaluated with the Clinical Dementia Rating 
Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB).16 The patient's ability to perform daily activities was evaluated with 
the Seoul Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (S-IADL) and Barthel Activity of Daily Living 
(BADL) scales.17 S-IADL can determine the performance of instrumental daily activities, which 
refers to daily activities necessary to maintain a social life. It is evaluated by interviewing a 
caregiver about the patient's condition during the past month. BADL is an indicator of basic 
daily activities and shows the level of ability to perform physical self-management activities 
needed to care for and maintain the body, such as eating meals, walking, bathing, and using 
the toilet. Neuropsychiatric features of patients were evaluated with the Caregiver Administered 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (CGA-NPI).18 The CGA-NPI is based on the following 12 abnormal 
behavioral symptoms commonly observed in patients with dementia: delusions, hallucinations, 
agitation, aggression, depression, discouragement, anxiety, indifference, disinhibition, 
abnormal movement, sleep, nighttime behavior, and changes in appetite or eating habits.

Assessments of caregivers
Adverse outcomes for caregivers were assessed with the ZBI, Korean version of the Caregiver 
Activity Survey (CAS-K), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Korean version of the Short 
Form Health Survey (SF-36) for both physical and mental HRQoL. The ZBI was designed to 
assess caregivers' psychological health, finances, emotional wellbeing, social and family life, 
and degree of control over their life. It consists of 22 items, each scored from 0 to 4, with a 
total score ranging from 0 to 88.19 The CAS-K examines the time spent by the caregivers in 
supporting the patient during the previous 24 hours from the time of the test.20 As much as 
possible, information was collected on weekdays, and the time spent on each item was recorded 
in hours and minutes for 6 items related to daily life support and behavior management 
of patients with dementia. The 6 items were: communicating with the person, using 
transportation, dressing, eating, looking after one's appearance, and supervising the person. 
The BDI is a reliable, accurate, and easy-to-use depression screening tool that can diagnose 
latent depression at an earlier stage.21 In the SF-36, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) 
and Mental Component Summary (MCS) are related to the caregiver's HRQoL and are the 
summarized indicators of physical and mental factors, which are calculated using the SF-36 
health survey measuring HRQoL with a questionnaire consisting of 36 items.22

Statistical analysis
Demographics and general characteristics of caregivers and patients were analyzed with 
descriptive statistics. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to examine relationships 
between the characteristics of the patient and caregiver. Multivariate linear regression analyses 
were performed to identify independent predictors associated with adverse outcomes for 
caregivers using stepwise backward variable selection. The age and sex of the patients and 
caregivers, and patient factors (K-MMSE, CDR-SB, S-IADL, BADL, and CGA-NPI) were included 
as predictors and caregiver factors (ZBI, CAS-K, BDI, and physical and mental HRQoL) were 
included as dependent variables. Statistical significance was inferred at p<0.05. All statistical 
analyses were performed using commercial software (SPSS 18.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

respectively. Approximately 67.8% of patients and 72.9% of caregivers were female. The mean 
years of education in patients and caregivers were 6.8 years and 12.5 years, respectively.

Regarding clinical features, the mean K-MMSE score was 16.1±5.7 and mean CDR-SB score 
was 7.1±4.4. Basic Activities of Daily Living (ADL) were measured with the BADL, with a mean 
score of 17.3±4.6, while instrumental ADL were measured with the S-IADL, with a mean score 
of 22.0±12.5. Neuropsychiatric features of patients were measured with the CGA-NPI, with a 
mean score of 15.9±9.8.

The mean score for caregiver burden, measured with the ZBI, was 40.7±20.3, and the total 
time spent supporting the patients in the preceding 24 hours was 11.9±6.6 hours. Depression 
in the caregiver was measured with the BDI, with a mean score of 14.1±9.9. In the SF36, the 
mean score for the PCS and the MCS was 46.6±10.4 and 38.0±15.0, respectively.

Correlation and linear regression analyses
Results from the Pearson's correlation analyses are summarized in Table 2. There were 
various correlations among factors, including age and sex of patients and caregivers, as 
well as other patient and caregiver characteristics. Assuming that the correlations between 
patient and caregiver factors could be reciprocal, we simplified the correlations to identify 
independent predictors for adverse outcomes in caregivers and subsequently performed 
linear regression analyses.

Results from the linear regression analyses are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 1. First, ZBI scores 
were higher in female caregivers (0.160, p<0.005) and positively correlated with patients' 
S-IADL (0.258, p<0.001) and CGA-NPI scores (0.278, p<0.001). On the contrary, patients' 
age was negatively correlated with ZBI scores (−0.221, p<0.001). There was also a positive 
correlation between time spent caring with patients' and CGA-NPI scores (0.272, p<0.001)

while time spent caring with patients was negatively correlated with patients' age (−0.230, 
p<0.001) and BADL (−0.229, p<0.001).

Depression amongst caregivers measured with the BDI was positively correlated with 
patients' CDR-SB scores (0.269, p<0.001). Physical HRQoL indicated by PCS scores was 
lower in female caregivers (−0.196, p<0.01) and exhibited positive correlation with BADL 
scores (0.195, p<0.001) but negative correlation with caregivers' age (−0.395, p<0.001). Lastly, 
mental HRQoL indicated by MCS scores was higher in patients with a more increased level 
of ADL (0.165, p<0.01) and older patients (0.198, p<0.001), but lower in patients with more 
abnormal behaviors (−0.208, p<0.001).

DISCUSSION

We investigated independent predictors of adverse outcomes in caregivers, including 
caregiver burden, depression, increased time spent caring, and poor physical and mental 
quality of life in a well-defined patient-caregiver cohort. We developed simplified prediction 
models using limited information that could be acquired easily in the physician's office. 
In addition to subjective adverse outcomes measured with the ZBI, we added an objective 
measure of time spent caring and tried to find meaningful diverse relationships.

Of all the adverse outcome measures, ZBI scores showed relationships with the largest number 
of patient and caregiver factors. As already mentioned in the introduction, ZBI is one of the 
most widely used measures of caregiver burden and is considered as an integrated score to 
measure subjective care burden. The ZBI results showed that female caregivers experienced 
a significantly higher care burden and this relationship with caregiver characteristics is 
consistent with previous studies.23-26 Regarding patient factors, increased S-IADL impairment 
and CGA-NPI scores were associated with an increased care burden, while BADL and K-MMSE 
scores were not observed as independent predictors of care burden. Our finding that S-IADL 
impairment was more strongly associated with caregiver burden than BADL was in agreement 
with some previous studies,9,27 but contrary to other studies.23,28 This may be due to the fact that 
patients who had been inpatients or who had lived in a residential care home were excluded 
and the participants' BADL were relatively preserved in the present study. There remains some 
controversy regarding the complicated associations of care burden measured with the ZBI with 
cognitive decline, functional decline, and behavioral symptoms.2,9,10,27

CAS-K scores were influenced by patients' CGA-NPI scores, age, and BADL. These findings 
are different from the results of previous studies, which showed that time spent caring was 
significantly correlated with only cognition and ADL.5,29 However, previous studies did not 
include the severity of dementia as an independent factor. In the present study, CDR-SB, 
which reflects the severity of dementia, was not correlated with any subjective measures of 
adverse outcome except for BDI, which is a measure of caregiver depression.

We observed that both physical and mental HRQoL were lower with worse patient BADL 
scores and in female caregivers. Physical HRQoL also decreased as caregivers became 
older and mental HRQoL decreased as patient's CGA-NPI scores increased. Regarding the 
relationship between functional and psychological impairment and caregivers' HRQoL, 
several previous studies have shown consistent results with the present study.6,30,31 However, 
there is controversy regarding the relationship between caregivers' HRQoL and demographic

factors such as caregivers' age and sex.6 A recent meta-analysis indicated that caregivers' age 
and sex were not associated with caregivers' HRQoL.6 However, in some studies, a female 
caregiver's HRQoL was more negatively affected compared to that of male caregivers.30,32 
Another study also reported an association between caregivers' age and HRQoL, which 
suggested that HRQoL decreased as caregivers became older.32 It could be presumed that 
older age influences the individual's ability and fatigability following physical activity, which 
would be linked directly with physical HRQoL.

Among the predictors, patients' age exhibited a major relationship with various adverse 
outcomes. Younger patients had increased ZBI scores, caregivers' BDI scores, and CAS-K 
scores, while they had lower mental HRQoL. These findings were in accordance with previous 
studies showing a greater care burden in caregivers of younger patients with dementia than 
in caregivers of older patients with dementia.7,33-36 However, the reasons for an increased 
care burden with younger patients is yet to be determined. The increase in subjective care 
burden indicated by BDI scores and mental HRQoL could be explained based on the presence 
of an association between psychological stress and the need for caregivers to accept the 
diagnosis of dementia at a younger age.7 The increase in objective caring time could be due 
to difficulties in controlling young patients with dementia who remain physically able and 
stronger compared to older patients. Interestingly, K-MMSE scores did not independently 
predict any adverse outcomes for caregivers. These results are in accordance with findings 
from previous studies suggesting that caregiver burden was not associated with the 
patient's cognitive status, but exhibited association with ADL impairment.31,37,38 These 
results emphasize the importance of functional evaluation of a patient's ability to care for 
themselves, rather than just cognition.

Although the present study provides several meaningful insights, some limitations should 
be borne in mind when considering our results. First, we developed simplified models for 
the analysis and did not include other characteristics of the caregiver such as the caregiver's 
relationship with the patient, spirituality, religion, personality, and social institutional 
arrangements. As already mentioned, we attempted to predict various adverse outcomes 
with data that can be easily obtained in the physician's office. Second, some studies have 
investigated reciprocal and multidimensional relationships between patient and caregiver 
factors, and even within caregiver factors; whereas we did not measure such a relationship. In 
the present study, we did not consider these relationships. Further investigation is needed to 
develop a comprehensive model for precise prediction of adverse outcomes.
